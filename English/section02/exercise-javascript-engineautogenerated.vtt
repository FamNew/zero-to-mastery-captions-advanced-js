Here's a fun little question Who do you think created the very first JavaScript engine.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.640
Just pause and think about this give up.

00:11.540 --> 00:18.570
Well the first person to create the very first JavaScript engine was its creator Brandon Knight.

00:18.650 --> 00:25.520
This man right over here while working at Netscape which became the first commercially available browser

00:25.850 --> 00:34.370
he created the early version of what became to be known as Spider Monkey which is what Firefox still

00:34.370 --> 00:41.210
uses right now as their JavaScript engine and Brendan Eich was the very first person who created the

00:41.210 --> 00:49.280
language javascript to implement this engine so that you're able to run javascript on a browser that

00:49.280 --> 00:54.510
previously could only read a simple and CSF fun little fact for you.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.120
