Hey Lou we're starting an advanced course with how javascript works but I already know how javascript

00:09.920 --> 00:10.330
works.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.320
I write JavaScript every day.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.260
Stop wasting my time Andre.

00:14.390 --> 00:20.900
I know you like to give me a hard time but let me ask you this when you write code on a file do you

00:20.900 --> 00:22.350
know what happens.

00:22.430 --> 00:25.630
How does the browser read this file.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.520
How is javascript executed.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.800
How does no GSA work.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.110
We write code in a text editor.

00:33.110 --> 00:40.110
And somehow this code magically turns into ones and zeros to tell the computer to do something.

00:40.220 --> 00:46.100
In this section and to begin this course I want to build what I think is the most important foundation

00:46.310 --> 00:48.470
of learning any language.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.420
If somebody asks you Hey can you explain how javascript works.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.080
As if I was five.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.990
You're going to be able to answer it by the end of this section knowing something deeply is being able

00:59.990 --> 01:06.550
to understand it so well that you can explain it to anybody even somebody without technical knowledge.

01:06.560 --> 01:12.110
More importantly you will have an understanding of the language at a deeper level than most people in

01:12.110 --> 01:18.600
the industry so that you can write better code let's have a look at what we're going to talk about in

01:18.600 --> 01:25.170
the first part we're going to talk about the JavaScript engine javascript runtime about interpreters

01:25.170 --> 01:27.450
compilers and JIT compilers.

01:27.510 --> 01:30.140
We're going to learn about writing optimized code.

01:30.270 --> 01:35.730
We're going to talk about call Stack's memory heaps and some of the things that we have to be careful

01:35.910 --> 01:40.400
when it comes to stacks and heaps and that is stack overflow and memory leaks.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.760
We're gonna talk a little bit about garbage collection about no J.

01:43.770 --> 01:51.060
Yes and how it fits into this whole javascript ecosystem and it's single threaded model and using what

01:51.060 --> 01:57.720
we learned in this section we're gonna be able to use these fundamentals as we learn higher and higher

01:57.720 --> 02:00.810
level concepts as we move throughout the course.

02:00.810 --> 02:06.480
So hang in there even if you have a good understanding of how javascript works you may learn a thing

02:06.480 --> 02:07.690
or two.

02:07.770 --> 02:13.200
We're also going to have a little bit of coding but most exercises in this section are going to be thought

02:13.200 --> 02:17.890
experiments and a lot more code is gonna come up in future sections.

02:18.060 --> 02:22.830
So hang in there and I hope you are as excited as I am to start the course.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.240
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.820
Let's get started shall we.

02:25.950 --> 02:26.720
See you in the next one.
