Almost everyone that has worked with JavaScript has heard of the V8 engine.

00:06.440 --> 00:12.830
The idea of the JavaScript engine and most people know that JavaScript is a single threaded language

00:13.520 --> 00:15.860
that it uses a callback queue.

00:15.920 --> 00:21.200
You may also hear phrases like Javascript is an interpreted language.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.650
Let's tackle what that means over the next couple of videos.

00:24.650 --> 00:28.410
What is this engine that we speak of well.

00:28.490 --> 00:39.010
If I write some code like let's say cost is happy equals to true Well we just wrote some javascript

00:39.670 --> 00:44.850
I'm assigning the true boolean to the variable is happy.

00:45.010 --> 00:50.730
Now how do we read this or how does the computer read this.

00:50.750 --> 00:56.210
Imagine if somebody comes up to you and gives you a computer and they tell you hey tell this computer

00:56.210 --> 01:02.960
to display a picture of horses on the screen and you start looking at this computer and you tell the

01:02.960 --> 01:10.390
computer to display an image of a horse or horses in French is the computer going to understand you

01:11.420 --> 01:16.450
know the computer would have no idea what you just said in similar fashion.

01:16.630 --> 01:26.370
If I gave a computer with a CB you a file that is a javascript file and I tell it hey read this file

01:26.370 --> 01:27.800
and do something for me.

01:27.990 --> 01:32.810
Well the computer only understands ones and zeros at the end of the day.

01:33.090 --> 01:38.820
And when we give it the javascript file it's like me talking to a computer in French and the computer

01:38.820 --> 01:40.550
being like What.

01:40.650 --> 01:42.150
What are you talking about.

01:42.180 --> 01:47.160
Plus talking to a computer in French while people are going to look at you like you're a crazy person.

01:47.160 --> 01:51.890
So the computer doesn't really know what javascript is.

01:51.990 --> 01:59.310
So how are we able to communicate using a javascript file so that the computer displays pictures of

01:59.310 --> 02:07.890
horses and this is the first step in our learning and that is the JavaScript engine by having a JavaScript

02:07.920 --> 02:09.900
engine right over here.

02:09.900 --> 02:14.000
It allows you to give this machine the javascript file.

02:14.340 --> 02:21.150
And this machine is going to understand this file and tell the computer what to do to display pictures

02:21.150 --> 02:22.290
of horses.

02:22.560 --> 02:28.590
In a sense you just created a translator so you can communicate with somebody that doesn't know your

02:28.590 --> 02:38.380
language and this special engine called the JavaScript engine understands javascript our computer finally

02:38.380 --> 02:39.090
understands us.

02:39.100 --> 02:46.060
Because of this javascript engine and it says I'm on it boss I'll start displaying those horse pictures.

02:46.070 --> 02:46.610
There you go.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.380
That's our first step.

02:48.440 --> 02:52.460
And over the next couple of videos we're going to talk about exactly what's happening inside.

02:53.060 --> 02:58.880
But do you think there's one JavaScript engine or many javascript engines.

02:58.880 --> 03:06.230
Well as you can see from this wikipedia list there are eight on of engines and they're called X must

03:06.230 --> 03:09.170
script engines and we'll get into why that is later.

03:09.170 --> 03:11.700
But these are all the javascript engines.

03:11.750 --> 03:17.490
Some of them you may have heard of like V8 or spider monkey or choker.

03:17.600 --> 03:25.370
So anytime we use an engine we're able to give it a javascript file and this javascript file gets understood

03:25.370 --> 03:33.110
by the engine and it allows this engine to communicate and tell the machine the computer to do what

03:33.110 --> 03:36.730
we ask it to do with JavaScript.

03:36.740 --> 03:43.980
Now these engines are written by programmers for example V8 engine is written in C++.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.280
But why do people write these engines.

03:47.360 --> 03:55.280
2008 marked a really pivotal moment in history when it comes to JavaScript because a V8 was released

03:55.310 --> 03:57.530
by Google before then.

03:57.590 --> 04:05.560
Most browsers used engines that were very basic which meant that JavaScript was a little bit slow.

04:05.570 --> 04:07.150
You see Google had this problem.

04:07.220 --> 04:13.940
They had something called Google Maps and Google Maps as you know requires a lot of power.

04:14.030 --> 04:20.180
It does a lot of things you can ask for directions to zoom in and zoom out maybe even use Street View

04:20.900 --> 04:27.320
and all the previous engines before it would make Google maps very very slow on the browser and Google

04:27.620 --> 04:29.940
because they're a search engine.

04:29.990 --> 04:36.380
They want everybody to use their search engine and they built a browser in order for them to control

04:36.380 --> 04:37.450
more of the market.

04:37.460 --> 04:43.940
So with Google Maps and their own Chrome browser they said we're going to write our own JavaScript engine

04:44.000 --> 04:52.860
the V8 engine so that JavaScript runs way faster on the browser than it's done previously and in 2008

04:53.070 --> 04:54.530
they released V8.

04:54.570 --> 05:00.510
But the big takeaway for us here is that really really smart people work on these engines so that our

05:00.510 --> 05:08.420
javascript runs as fast as possible on the browser on the server or any type of computer.

05:08.490 --> 05:15.160
So every day javascript gets faster and faster for us because of the work that goes into these engines.

05:15.160 --> 05:22.710
OK but what is inside this engine this magical machine that understands javascript it reads our code

05:22.740 --> 05:25.460
and then it runs this code.

05:25.570 --> 05:28.480
Let's get into that in the upcoming video by.
