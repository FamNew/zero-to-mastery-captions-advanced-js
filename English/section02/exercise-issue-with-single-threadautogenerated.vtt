What problems do you see with synchronous code.

00:05.390 --> 00:10.420
Think about that for a second positive video if you need to ready for the answer.

00:11.690 --> 00:20.650
Well with single threaded synchronous code that JavaScript engine runs it's going to make it really

00:20.650 --> 00:21.780
really difficult.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.790
If we have long running tasks what does that mean.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.110
Imagine we are running Twitter and Twitter.

00:31.130 --> 00:37.190
Well it's an application that we can tweet we can check other people's tweets.

00:37.190 --> 00:42.480
We can look at followers our tweets our notifications our messages.

00:42.530 --> 00:50.450
Imagine if they had a function that had let's say a really big loop that takes five seconds to complete.

00:50.450 --> 00:54.120
When that happens if we just use the JavaScript engine.

00:54.140 --> 00:55.810
Well I wouldn't be able to click.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.030
I wouldn't be able to scroll.

00:58.130 --> 01:00.380
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

01:00.380 --> 01:05.230
A classic example of this is the alert function if I run.

01:05.240 --> 01:05.750
Alert

01:11.090 --> 01:15.380
my javascript is running right now and I can scroll.

01:15.380 --> 01:16.920
I can't click anywhere.

01:17.030 --> 01:23.990
The Web site is frozen in time until I take some sort of action and this mimics a long running javascript

01:23.990 --> 01:25.970
right on the call stack.

01:25.970 --> 01:29.780
Right now we have something like a function that's running.

01:29.780 --> 01:34.910
And until that call stack is empty I can't really do anything.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.470
That's terrible.

01:36.470 --> 01:38.770
Why would anybody use javascript.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.810
I mean it's just going to slow our pages down.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.860
Right.

01:42.950 --> 01:47.880
Well here's the thing I haven't been completely honest with you.

01:47.900 --> 01:54.650
That's because when we talk about JavaScript most of the time you're never just using the JavaScript

01:54.650 --> 01:57.020
engine which is synchronous.

01:57.020 --> 02:03.430
We need to introduce I had the idea of asynchronous code and in the next couple of videos we're going

02:03.430 --> 02:10.130
to talk about what's actually happening behind the scenes where it's not just the JavaScript engine

02:10.490 --> 02:11.840
that's running our code.

02:11.960 --> 02:18.920
We have something called the javascript runtime and as we'll see no J.S. will also implement something

02:18.920 --> 02:28.310
similar because in order for us to write code that we can use in this modern day we need something beyond

02:28.370 --> 02:30.020
just the JavaScript engine.

02:30.740 --> 02:34.330
I know I know we're almost getting there to our complete picture.

02:34.430 --> 02:36.980
Hang in there because this is gonna be a fun one.

02:37.550 --> 02:39.500
I'll see in the next one by.
