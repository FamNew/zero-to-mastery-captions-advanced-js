Javascript is a single threaded programming language.

00:06.880 --> 00:07.570
What does that mean.

00:08.320 --> 00:15.350
Well being single threaded means that only one set of instructions is executed at a time.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.890
It's not doing multiple things.

00:17.890 --> 00:25.030
And the biggest way to check that a language is single threaded is well it has only one call stack.

00:25.030 --> 00:29.140
This one call stack allows us to run code one at a time.

00:29.290 --> 00:36.940
We're never running functions in parallel as you saw the stack keeps growing as we push new functions

00:37.030 --> 00:40.680
on the stack and then we pop them one at a time.

00:40.720 --> 00:49.510
Now initially in 1995 when javascript was born this made things easy for implementation and for developers

00:49.600 --> 00:51.110
using the language right.

00:51.370 --> 00:58.450
Because javascript was only initially a language useful for adding interactions on a web page such as

00:58.450 --> 01:06.000
form validations or clicking a button nothing really required having more than just a single thread

01:07.140 --> 01:14.830
a good way to think about it is like this single threaded means I'm the JavaScript engine and I'm eating

01:14.830 --> 01:21.820
with one hand putting food in my mouth that is the function and then use that same hand to grab the

01:21.820 --> 01:25.660
next food when I'm done chewing my food.

01:25.760 --> 01:31.340
I can't put any more things in my mouth until I'm done chewing and I also can't grab anymore food until

01:31.340 --> 01:32.830
I finish chewing.

01:33.020 --> 01:34.530
It's single threaded.

01:34.610 --> 01:35.530
One thing at a time.

01:36.710 --> 01:46.070
And because of this javascript is synchronous that is wanted to time in order that it appears only one

01:46.070 --> 01:48.840
thing can happen at the time.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.500
You might be asking yourself that doesn't sound super fast does it.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.360
Let's tackle that in the next video.
