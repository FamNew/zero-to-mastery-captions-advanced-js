00:01.070 --> 00:02.100
Welcome back.

00:02.120 --> 00:10.580
Let's finally learn about yes six modules javascript needed a way to support modules because it's now

00:10.580 --> 00:12.170
a serious language.

00:12.200 --> 00:19.010
It's not just for the browser you can use javascript anywhere on the server on mobile on desktop on

00:19.100 --> 00:26.480
IO T devices and as applications grow larger and larger as we've learned we need modules.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.120
And luckily we don't have to worry about common Jesus M.D. or UMD anymore.

00:31.160 --> 00:38.380
I mean you'll still see common G.S. in node programs but we're gonna have native iOS 6 modules A.J.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.170
as soon as well.

00:40.190 --> 00:46.220
So how is this going to look just like this.

00:46.240 --> 00:57.920
We have a native keyword now called import that imports a module from what profile we want and a nother

00:57.920 --> 01:01.540
module from another JavaScript file that we want.

01:01.730 --> 01:04.010
And anytime we want to export something.

01:04.040 --> 01:11.430
Well we do export and whatever we want to export how nice and simple is that.

01:11.480 --> 01:20.150
Let's turn our code that was originally just a simple module pattern into using iOS 6 modules.

01:20.270 --> 01:30.130
Well all we're going to do is copy our fight function and this fight function well we don't need jump

01:30.130 --> 01:30.650
function.

01:30.670 --> 01:34.960
It's not doing anything or let's keep it there just for fun.

01:34.960 --> 01:42.940
I'm going to copy the fight function and we're in yes sixth line now so let's just change this to const

01:44.830 --> 01:51.390
you won't do anything for now but it just looks nicer and I also want Harry involved in more variables

01:51.480 --> 01:52.250
to come with me.

01:52.260 --> 01:58.080
So I'm going to grab those and put them up here.

01:58.530 --> 02:01.220
We'll change these two constants as well.

02:02.820 --> 02:08.580
Again that doesn't really affect imports or export is just we're in modern javascript land now.

02:08.580 --> 02:12.620
So might as well use the modern features.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.540
Now here's the thing.

02:14.820 --> 02:21.520
All we need to do to export this and make this available is to.

02:21.520 --> 02:26.020
Well first of all let's remove the imports because we're not importing anything in here.

02:26.110 --> 02:34.390
All I need to do to say hey I want you to export a function or a variable from this file is to add the

02:35.080 --> 02:44.590
export keyword so that if I do export function fight I'm going to have access to it and everything that

02:44.650 --> 02:51.370
I don't export like Harry and Voldemort or maybe I don't want to export jump because this is a private

02:51.370 --> 02:52.040
function.

02:52.120 --> 02:57.460
Well then nobody else is going to get access to it except for whoever is working on this file.

02:57.610 --> 03:05.720
So let's remove our module pattern and see how this works in the browser.

03:05.790 --> 03:08.150
I'm going to go down here.

03:08.190 --> 03:11.630
Let's minimize our scripts that we aren't using.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.140
And now with our last script

03:16.570 --> 03:29.500
I'm going to add a new file or we can just do it here we're going to import the fight function from

03:30.160 --> 03:35.860
the well what should we import it from we import it from script file right over here

03:40.020 --> 03:43.260
and this is called a named export.

03:43.260 --> 03:49.770
I can do as many exports as I want if I wanted to export jump for example I can just say export here

03:50.430 --> 03:55.530
and I can import it just like that.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.080
But you need these curly brackets.

03:58.090 --> 04:05.280
Another way to export it is to actually do something called a default export and a default export is

04:05.480 --> 04:09.160
while you just add a default in here export default function.

04:09.360 --> 04:16.380
And now this is the default function or default item that gets imported.

04:16.420 --> 04:20.490
So you don't need the brackets anymore because it should only be one.

04:20.500 --> 04:20.770
All right.

04:20.770 --> 04:22.410
So we imported this.

04:22.630 --> 04:30.190
And just to see that we have this working I'm going to say in here fight and then we'll fight Ron against

04:31.120 --> 04:34.080
Hedwig.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.190
Now let's see if this actually works.

04:36.250 --> 04:42.580
I'm going to save this and refresh and I get an error.

04:42.630 --> 04:49.140
Mm hmm unexpected identifier export it doesn't recognize our import and export statements.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.100
But why.

04:51.100 --> 04:57.500
I mean I thought you told me that yes six modules are available right.

04:57.560 --> 05:02.060
Well yes there are but there's one other trick.

05:02.110 --> 05:05.360
Well actually two other tricks to make this work.

05:05.410 --> 05:15.760
One is that you now have to define this script as a type module and again this is a new feature where

05:15.760 --> 05:18.120
you have to tell it hey what we're doing here.

05:18.130 --> 05:19.330
This is a module.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.430
It's not a regular script like we've had in in the past.

05:22.480 --> 05:30.490
This is a CSX module and same thing here anytime we use import and export we have to tell it hey this

05:31.480 --> 05:32.200
is a module.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.370
So now if I save this and refresh

05:39.040 --> 05:46.040
it looks like I'm still getting an error now because it's not just a regular script that the browser

05:46.040 --> 05:46.460
reads.

05:46.490 --> 05:47.510
It's a module.

05:47.510 --> 05:51.300
We actually need to serve it from a server.

05:51.380 --> 05:59.290
So I'm going to use a tool called Life server and you can do this with any type of a shitty server.

05:59.300 --> 06:06.590
This is the one that I like and all you do is say live server from the project that you're working with.

06:06.620 --> 06:12.380
And as long as you have an index not a small file they'll open it for you.

06:12.410 --> 06:12.960
All right.

06:13.010 --> 06:20.930
So we have our browser but I see that Oh I failed to resolve module specified I have to tell it where

06:20.930 --> 06:22.970
the script file is.

06:23.030 --> 06:26.390
So it's script dot James that we're looking for.

06:26.390 --> 06:35.040
If I save this and go back hey look at that Hedwig wins we're able to use the fight function and export

06:35.040 --> 06:36.840
it from one module to another.

06:37.050 --> 06:46.920
If I keep refreshing here every once in a while hopefully Ron wins as well.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.670
There you go.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.350
Ron is not very good at this because while he's only got three letters but every once in a while Ron

06:52.350 --> 06:53.660
wins as well.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.460
Awesome.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.060
And there you have it.

06:57.120 --> 07:06.810
How much simpler was that instead of worrying about if he's module patents common G.S. and M.D. and

07:06.810 --> 07:13.840
making sure that things worked across the browser and things worked as a third package on NPM.

07:13.950 --> 07:19.190
We now have simple import and export statements that we can use.

07:19.590 --> 07:26.040
By the way if for example we had something like this where we had export function and an export default

07:26.040 --> 07:34.350
function well we can simply import it this way where we have fight and then because the other one is

07:34.350 --> 07:44.220
not a default export we just do jump like this so that if we console that log jump and jump start on

07:44.220 --> 07:55.200
doing anything right now so let's just console log jump here and save both of these and go back to our

07:55.200 --> 08:03.000
file and look at that Hedwig wins and jump is working but because we're now using modules.

08:03.390 --> 08:08.240
Well I can't really use it in here if I do jump.

08:08.310 --> 08:13.500
No that's a different module you have to explicitly tell me that you're importing something if you want

08:13.500 --> 08:13.950
to use it.

08:14.580 --> 08:18.030
So now we're not polluting the global namespace.

08:18.030 --> 08:23.660
If I go to window I'm not gonna see jump or fight or anything like that on there.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.160
How awesome is that.

08:26.160 --> 08:32.340
Now import and export makes things really really easy and I'll link to ways that you can import different

08:32.340 --> 08:39.240
functionality from other modules but like you see over here there's just a few ways of doing it differently

08:39.690 --> 08:42.080
that you can learn on your own.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.280
It's not very difficult.

08:43.280 --> 08:50.450
The idea behind it is to keep everything simple so let's finish off this section with our conclusion.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.380
What we have now with modules.
