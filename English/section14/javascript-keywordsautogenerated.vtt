Welcome back.

00:02.450 --> 00:08.840
I wanted to show you something that we haven't really talked about but again it's important to know

00:08.930 --> 00:15.220
and that is that JavaScript has its own language to start off with.

00:15.530 --> 00:22.070
And these are called key words and you can see here these are all javascript keywords and what they

00:22.070 --> 00:30.680
mean is that when I change this from Mark down to JavaScript well all of these can see you have changed

00:31.100 --> 00:38.150
colors and that is because all these words are cues within javascript that if you use them it already

00:38.150 --> 00:41.610
has a predefined meaning attached to it.

00:41.610 --> 00:44.550
So for example if we open up the browser

00:48.770 --> 01:00.150
and I do a variable for he calls seven I'll get a syntax error because well four is used for for loop

01:00.390 --> 01:09.840
I can't do var equals var equals eight because well var already means something in JavaScript So javascript

01:09.840 --> 01:15.040
keywords are words that you cannot use because it'll have unintended consequences.

01:15.060 --> 01:20.790
JavaScript is gonna read it and say Oh you're trying to meet something that I already know the meaning

01:20.790 --> 01:28.600
of so this list over here you just have to be cautious that you don't name your variables or your functions

01:29.020 --> 01:30.370
this way.

01:30.370 --> 01:35.740
But as you can see these are the words that we've been using up until this point to create functions

01:35.740 --> 01:41.260
to create for loops and we'll encounter these throughout the course.

01:41.380 --> 01:47.260
But I wanted to leave this for you in the next section so that you'll have it as a reference.

01:47.260 --> 01:52.560
I also want to show you what we've learned so far and I'm going to change this back to markdown.

01:52.570 --> 02:00.190
So it's a little bit cleaner look at all this stuff we've done we've done looping we've learned about

02:00.190 --> 02:08.830
data structures we've learned about functions logical operators conditionals variables comparisons and

02:08.830 --> 02:15.310
types and there's still a few things that are great out here but we've learned 80 percent of what's

02:15.310 --> 02:18.470
really really important in JavaScript these other ones.

02:18.490 --> 02:24.970
We'll get to it in the advance section but what we've learned up until now is something that all computer

02:24.970 --> 02:32.050
programs have once you learned this if you wanted to learn a new language there's small minor differences

02:32.080 --> 02:37.450
but they all have types they all have conditionals they all have loops.

02:37.450 --> 02:44.230
So once you master one programming language you can move on to others a lot faster than your first one

02:45.700 --> 02:52.330
so use that as motivation to go through all these things that we've learned because in the next few

02:52.330 --> 02:55.570
sections we're going to learn even more.

02:55.570 --> 02:56.820
We've got an A law covered.

02:56.830 --> 02:59.630
I'm really proud of you making it this far.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.950
Can't wait to see you on the next video.

03:01.950 --> 03:02.270
Bye bye.
