Hello.

00:01.740 --> 00:03.000
Welcome back.

00:03.000 --> 00:10.350
In this video we're going to combine everything that we just learned to show you why javascript is useful

00:10.560 --> 00:13.370
because I know some of your thinking.

00:13.610 --> 00:13.820
OK.

00:13.830 --> 00:21.090
We learned a whole bunch of new ways of writing javascript and we learned about arrays and objects but

00:21.390 --> 00:27.180
I don't really know how that relates to me building Web sites or Web apps.

00:27.180 --> 00:33.950
Well I'm going to show you that we can build a simplified version of Facebook with what we just learned

00:35.190 --> 00:36.740
so let's get started.

00:36.750 --> 00:43.130
We're gonna have a database with usernames and passwords we're going to have a news feed and we're gonna

00:43.140 --> 00:44.760
have users.

00:44.760 --> 00:50.830
So let's start off by thinking about how Facebook works with Facebook.

00:50.940 --> 00:59.940
We have a sign up form usually we need to sign in and once we sign in if it's correct it goes to our

01:00.000 --> 01:08.370
profile where we can view our news feed so let's build that we can start off with having something called

01:08.850 --> 01:09.690
a database.

01:10.140 --> 01:11.870
So we'll have a variable database.

01:12.450 --> 01:16.740
And in this database we can have multiple users.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.270
Right.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.900
So what do we need here.

01:18.900 --> 01:23.150
We need an array a list of users.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.740
So now I can say

01:28.060 --> 01:33.980
I have a user name and this might look familiar from our previous lessons.

01:34.150 --> 01:42.500
We'll have a user name of Andre and a password of super secret.

01:42.740 --> 01:46.610
For now we're just going to leave it at one user.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.640
We have a database and we also want to have a news feed right.

01:50.660 --> 01:54.200
So let's have a variable called news feed.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.660
And in here a news feed.

01:56.660 --> 02:14.820
Well again it's a list an array of news so we can have a user name Bobby that on his timeline has maybe

02:15.540 --> 02:22.160
so tired from all that learning.

02:22.190 --> 02:26.110
We also have we we have more than one item usually in a news feed.

02:26.120 --> 02:42.200
We can say that user name Sally Sally on her timeline just posted javascript is so cool OK.

02:42.510 --> 02:52.960
So we have a new seed which has an array of objects and we have a database which is an array of just

02:52.960 --> 02:56.890
a single object right now a username and password.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.280
Now how can we build a sign and form.

03:01.280 --> 03:10.620
Well we would want to perform an action to check a user's credentials their username and password well

03:10.620 --> 03:11.980
we've done this before right.

03:12.010 --> 03:25.650
We've used prompt before accepts a user's input so we can do variable user name prompt we'll say equals

03:25.680 --> 03:26.190
prompt

03:29.620 --> 03:35.640
what's your user name OK.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.870
We also have.

03:36.870 --> 03:39.260
I'm going to make this smaller just so everything fits in here.

03:39.270 --> 03:50.690
Hopefully you can still see we have variable password prompt that equals prompt.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.950
What's your password.

03:54.100 --> 04:05.670
Question mark OK so we have this working when we open up this file and refresh H2 e-mail is gonna get

04:05.670 --> 04:06.370
loaded.

04:06.420 --> 04:11.240
Line by line and we see we have a script.

04:11.290 --> 04:17.590
Let me load the script and then the browser reads line by line.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.990
We have a database.

04:19.210 --> 04:25.240
We have a news feed and then it's going to say user name prompt equals prompt and it's going to ask

04:25.240 --> 04:30.480
us for what's your user name and then it's going to ask us for what's your password.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.410
Well let's just test that.

04:32.410 --> 04:35.380
I'm going to save and refresh and there you go.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.530
What's your new user name Andre.

04:38.740 --> 04:43.180
And what's your password super secret.

04:43.180 --> 04:47.080
That's very nice but when I sign in.

04:47.080 --> 04:54.970
I either want to know that my password is incorrect or if I log in and everything is correct I'm gonna

04:55.000 --> 04:56.610
get my niece fee right.

04:57.890 --> 05:05.510
So it sounds like we need to perform an action but we don't really have a sign in function in javascript

05:05.510 --> 05:05.870
do we.

05:05.870 --> 05:13.040
It's a custom function that we need to build ourself so let's think about this.

05:13.050 --> 05:20.930
We want to create a function called sign in and to sign in what do we need.

05:20.930 --> 05:29.130
Well we need a user name and password and we can name these whatever we want.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.400
And just to prove that to you I'm just gonna do user

05:35.150 --> 05:36.350
and password.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.360
We'll do pass like that OK.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.530
And if we remember to create a function this is function declaration.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.850
I have my curly brackets and in here I can do something.

05:48.270 --> 05:53.710
So again let's think about this logically in order to sign in.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.870
I need to check username and password.

05:57.560 --> 06:08.920
Well if the function gets the first argument to user Bill I can say that if user name on this case user

06:10.720 --> 06:11.620
equals.

06:11.890 --> 06:12.850
Well what does it equal.

06:12.850 --> 06:17.090
We need to check against our database right.

06:17.290 --> 06:25.720
Our database when Andre signed up for Facebook he put his user name down and password down so we have

06:25.720 --> 06:28.600
that information so we can say that when you sign in.

06:28.600 --> 06:34.390
We're gonna check user to see that the user matches database.

06:35.530 --> 06:36.810
And it's an array.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.580
So we're gonna grab the first element in the array and we're gonna grab the user name

06:50.010 --> 06:50.920
OK.

06:51.060 --> 06:55.260
And we also want to check the password drain.

06:55.290 --> 07:03.110
So what do we do when we have to check two things both a conditional that has and so here I can say

07:03.890 --> 07:11.240
password should equal database first item in the array.

07:11.240 --> 07:17.460
And this time instead of username it's password I'm going to put this on our new line just so you can

07:17.460 --> 07:18.100
see it.

07:18.120 --> 07:29.360
There you go so sign and function is going to say if user equals whatever we have in the database username

07:29.810 --> 07:33.690
and password equals whatever we have in the database.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.110
If that is right.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.490
Well we can say Soledad.

07:38.560 --> 07:48.390
Log and we'll say news feed else if the password or username is not correct.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.080
We'll just stay alert.

07:51.490 --> 07:55.060
Sorry wrong user name and password

07:58.930 --> 08:03.720
so we have our function but this disappeared somewhere.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.640
And we'll save this.

08:06.750 --> 08:11.400
And let's just refresh OK what is your user name.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.330
We'll say Andre and what is your password.

08:15.330 --> 08:18.280
Well we'll say super secret.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.880
I press enter.

08:19.980 --> 08:20.300
OK.

08:20.310 --> 08:25.580
And now nothing happens because well we haven't called the function right.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.760
We just know that sign it exists.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.550
Let's just check that sign and exists.

08:31.440 --> 08:37.270
Sign in is not defined oh it's because I spelled it.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.030
I spelled it wrong.

08:39.030 --> 08:40.110
Let's do signing again.

08:40.140 --> 08:51.120
Let's refresh Andre super secret and if I look for a sign and now yep there's the function.

08:51.310 --> 08:52.630
So let's run it.

08:52.630 --> 09:05.580
Let's do sign in and we'll say user name prompt password prompt.

09:05.730 --> 09:08.590
We just received our news feed.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.240
That's very cool.

09:09.270 --> 09:10.980
Let's put this inside though.

09:10.980 --> 09:15.900
So the script just runs and and we'll get our answer right away.

09:16.200 --> 09:25.440
So we'll do user name prompt and password prompt now just to show you what I did here.

09:25.600 --> 09:31.510
I am calling the function signing that accepts two parameters user and password.

09:32.390 --> 09:38.740
So when I call the function I'm going to give it to arguments to match those parameters.

09:38.900 --> 09:43.700
I'm going to give it the user name prompt which contains whatever we've written in the first prompt

09:44.240 --> 09:47.170
and then password prompt which contains whatever we've written.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.930
And the second prompt.

09:49.010 --> 09:56.230
So now if I save this and refresh I can say what's your username Andre.

09:56.480 --> 10:02.290
Password super secret and look at that.

10:02.420 --> 10:08.750
Now I'm logged in and I can view that Bobby is so tired from all that learning and Sally Well Sally

10:08.750 --> 10:16.250
finds javascript really really cool let's also try out the L statement in case we mess up our information

10:16.490 --> 10:24.740
I press refresh and I'll do Andre and for password I'll just do one two three I'll get sorry wrong user

10:24.740 --> 10:27.510
name and password.

10:27.580 --> 10:28.590
There you go.

10:28.720 --> 10:35.560
We've built a basic Facebook and that's what's so amazing about JavaScript is that you look at Web sites

10:35.560 --> 10:41.380
like Facebook that seem really really complicated but they're all made of these small chunks and the

10:41.380 --> 10:48.900
functionality that you see on Facebook is exactly that we are signing in and they're checking the signing

10:48.940 --> 10:55.000
information against the database and then based on if we're right or wrong we either get the news feed

10:55.000 --> 11:01.480
or we get you know please sign in again and that's the power of JavaScript right here and this is why

11:01.510 --> 11:07.690
I'm so excited to teach you the topic because it opens up a whole new possibility of pretty much doing

11:07.900 --> 11:14.270
anything online now I have another exciting video for you coming up next.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.190
I'll see you on that one by.
