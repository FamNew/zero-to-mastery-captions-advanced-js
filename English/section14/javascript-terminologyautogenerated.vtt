Hey there welcome back in this quick video.

00:03.300 --> 00:06.650
I just want to go over the terminology that we've been using again.

00:06.690 --> 00:14.700
I'm just going to repeat it so that you really have it nailed the first one that we've learned about

00:14.970 --> 00:23.250
is the idea of function declaration and function declaration is a way for us to create functions

00:29.640 --> 00:31.830
like this.

00:31.850 --> 00:39.860
We also learned about function expression and function expression is a way for us to create functions

00:40.340 --> 00:41.600
with a variable like

00:44.250 --> 00:44.640
this

00:50.740 --> 01:01.350
and function expressions can also have aims.

01:01.410 --> 01:04.880
It could be an anonymous function like this.

01:05.160 --> 01:09.820
You're more likely to encounter this than with names.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.700
But I want to show you both of those.

01:12.710 --> 01:13.380
OK.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.520
What else do we have.

01:14.580 --> 01:19.880
We also had this idea of expression and an expression is.

01:19.980 --> 01:27.510
Well this actually gives it a good good overview and expression is something that denotes a value.

01:27.540 --> 01:34.120
So one plus three is an expression and we end expressions with semicolon.

01:34.290 --> 01:38.230
If we do a variable A equals two that's an expression.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.000
If we're returning something from a function we're returning true.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.900
That's an expression.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.620
So an expression it's something that produces a value.

01:46.620 --> 01:46.970
OK.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.390
How do we make a function perform that action.

01:51.390 --> 01:57.930
Who will we call that calling or invoking a function.

01:59.040 --> 02:10.860
And we do that by doing alert and then the brackets or we can do something like new function parameter

02:10.860 --> 02:19.200
one parameter 2 and we call or invoke a function this way.

02:19.370 --> 02:25.630
We also assign a variable and we do that by.

02:25.640 --> 02:31.960
Well we assign a variable a true.

02:32.140 --> 02:32.390
OK.

02:32.390 --> 02:46.580
We also learn about function vs. methods or method and a function is something like this is a function

02:50.000 --> 03:01.310
a method is something that is inside of an object like this is a method

03:04.850 --> 03:19.450
so the way we access them is different function is accessed like this a method is accessed with a dot

03:19.510 --> 03:20.110
in front of it

03:24.620 --> 03:31.370
and there you have it a few terminologies that I've been using them hopefully you've learned them by

03:31.370 --> 03:38.600
now but wanted to recap everything so that it really really sticks and this should make everything more

03:38.600 --> 03:42.190
clear I'll see in the next one by.
