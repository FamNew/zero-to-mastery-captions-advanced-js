WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:02.940
And welcome back.

00:02.940 --> 00:10.770
We're going to take a quick break from learning javascript syntax to show you how javascript gets implemented

00:11.130 --> 00:12.390
in the browser.

00:12.390 --> 00:17.160
We're going to go back to this image that we've seen many times before in this course.

00:17.370 --> 00:22.620
And we have a pretty good idea of what a e-mail and CSX does.

00:22.620 --> 00:31.800
If you remember a CML gets sent to the browser then it sees the link tag and the CSX gets sent to the

00:31.800 --> 00:32.570
browser.

00:32.580 --> 00:36.220
But what about our new friend javascript over here.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.730
What happens with him well in this video.

00:40.910 --> 00:46.980
We're going to learn exactly that so I have over here an index that ACM all file.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.400
I'm going to open it with Google Chrome.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.960
It's completely empty now.

00:51.200 --> 00:57.370
And I'm also going to drag it to my sublime text so that we can add something to it

01:00.310 --> 01:06.700
so I have Sublime Text and the browser and we're gonna use our little short command to create a quick

01:06.750 --> 01:21.560
a simple file javascript and let's just have a simple header that says javascript and HMO save and refresh.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.220
Perfect.

01:22.220 --> 01:23.870
We're M. is this already.

01:23.870 --> 01:26.080
We all know what's going on.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.770
So how do we add javascript to this.

01:29.780 --> 01:35.430
I mean with CSX we had the link tag right.

01:35.600 --> 01:47.260
And we had this track where we tell it where it is well if you remember javascript again just like a

01:47.290 --> 01:49.790
months assess is just a file.

01:49.990 --> 01:54.490
So let's create one first and sublime text.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.960
I'm going to create a new file.

01:56.060 --> 02:02.690
I'm going to save it and I'm going to say script dot J S see the dot J.S. at the end.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.610
That means javascript.

02:04.610 --> 02:09.830
Notice what happens when I click save at the bottom sublime text.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.660
Now converted the syntax to javascript.

02:13.770 --> 02:22.320
So now I can write something like four plus three and I get the cool javascript colors I can write if

02:23.100 --> 02:38.440
four plus three equals seven I can alert you're smart so you can see that it does the syntax for me

02:39.960 --> 02:44.640
OK perfect man I just save that.

02:44.710 --> 02:47.640
Let's see if we can add this to.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.180
I forgot the semicolon here.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.010
I always forget it too.

02:51.160 --> 03:01.140
Let's add this to our HMO if it works we'll get an alert saying you're a smart so how can we do this.

03:01.210 --> 03:09.590
Well there's an Asian male tag called script tag so link tag for style sheet.

03:09.680 --> 03:15.460
Script tag for JavaScript and all we do is this.

03:15.600 --> 03:25.230
We have that type text javascript you see over here how with CSX we have text CSX while we're telling

03:25.230 --> 03:39.850
it that this is javascript and in here JavaScript can be run right over here if I go alert Hello.

03:40.290 --> 03:45.200
And you might remember this because it's kind of like the style tag for CSX.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.330
Let's see what happens.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.090
And to refresh and I get Hello.

03:51.090 --> 03:51.710
Look at that.

03:51.870 --> 04:01.350
We just added javascript to our HMO but I really want to use this file as we know with CSX.

04:01.350 --> 04:06.420
We don't necessarily want our javascript to live on a simple we want separation of concerns.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.090
We want the javascript and the javascript file.

04:09.120 --> 04:18.690
Well the way we do that is through a source file so all we do is source.

04:18.710 --> 04:20.810
You might remember this from images.

04:20.810 --> 04:31.820
So instead of h ref and link we have source and we say script dot J S I save and I refresh and I get

04:32.090 --> 04:34.860
your smart now.

04:35.020 --> 04:40.240
Again we can say script digest because well it's in the same folder.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.860
It's in the desktop folder.

04:41.980 --> 04:49.090
If it wasn't then let's say this a Shia e-mail wasn't in the desktop folder we'd have to do something

04:49.090 --> 04:51.160
like desktop

04:57.650 --> 04:58.860
OK.

04:59.100 --> 05:06.390
So that's very interesting what if I have multiple JavaScript files we might have seen that in remember

05:06.390 --> 05:07.560
bootstrap and bootstrap.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.100
We had like three script tags.

05:09.720 --> 05:17.280
Well yeah you can just just like he can with link you can have multiple script X and you can just say

05:17.610 --> 05:29.950
script to script 3 and again each one gets executed one at a time OK now one question you might have

05:29.950 --> 05:38.020
is why did I just put the script tag at the bottom here at the bottom of the body.

05:38.210 --> 05:41.120
Why didn't we let me just remove this for now.

05:41.150 --> 05:47.540
Why don't we just put it at the top like we do with the CSF file.

05:47.650 --> 05:48.620
Well let me show you something.

05:49.190 --> 05:50.450
Let's put it up here.

05:50.510 --> 05:51.910
Let's see what happens.

05:51.920 --> 05:59.130
I'm going to refresh OK I get your smart.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.260
I don't know if you saw that.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.030
Did you see the javascript go.

06:02.130 --> 06:09.210
Let's change this quickly let's say our Web site is now fresh and new and I'm going to say waiting for

06:09.390 --> 06:19.560
JavaScript going to save notice what happens to the header I refresh it hasn't changed yet I have to

06:19.560 --> 06:30.260
click your smart you see it's completely gone click OK and only then it shows up because the browser

06:30.470 --> 06:38.090
reads the file goes and gets the CSX file and then sees a script tag and says well I'm going to go read

06:38.090 --> 06:41.170
what's over here and here is an alert.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.790
And what an alert does it.

06:42.800 --> 06:52.070
It waits for us to click OK so the browser can't display waiting for JavaScript so you will see an older

06:52.070 --> 06:57.950
Web sites people that put the script tags in here but that actually delays what gets seen by the user

06:58.790 --> 07:11.010
instead if we put it down here and change the text again to not waiting in a safe let's see what happens

07:13.190 --> 07:20.390
not waiting for JavaScript that got changed so we ideally want to put our script tags at the bottom

07:20.390 --> 07:21.220
of the body.

07:21.350 --> 07:31.190
What that means is that the Web site gets displayed gets rendered and then we have to still wait for

07:31.190 --> 07:33.840
the javascript to load let's say we had a cool animation.

07:33.960 --> 07:41.060
You'll have to wait until that loads but to a user it appears like the Web site loads a lot faster because

07:41.360 --> 07:46.220
they might not click on a drop down menu or see the animation right away and notice that there is a

07:46.220 --> 07:50.130
lie but they will see a delay if they don't see anything on the page.

07:50.250 --> 07:56.140
So script tax at the bottom one last thing.

07:56.320 --> 08:04.390
How do we get that console to print stuff out it would be nice if instead of alert all the time I can

08:04.390 --> 08:05.800
get something in the console.

08:05.860 --> 08:19.770
Well in JavaScript you can do something called console to log and here I can say hello so this syntax

08:19.770 --> 08:20.600
is a little bit weird.

08:20.600 --> 08:28.820
I'll explain later on what is going on here but console dialogue is a special little syntax that we

08:28.820 --> 08:29.540
can use.

08:29.540 --> 08:39.370
And now if I refresh the page I get logging over here so I can write as much as I want here.

08:39.380 --> 08:46.970
Kind of like alert but without getting that annoying pop up over and over and refresh and I get hello

08:47.450 --> 08:51.440
and we'll be using console log a lot in the next couple of videos.

08:51.770 --> 08:59.120
You can see here that it's a nice way for us to print something to the console before we learn how to

08:59.480 --> 09:03.310
change our e-mail so I'll see in the next four.
