WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:09.060
Welcome back javascript was created in 1995 five but the Netscape web browser right over here it was

00:09.070 --> 00:13.660
a way for them to be able to add actions to Web sites.

00:13.660 --> 00:18.440
Think of JavaScript as the verb in anything you do on a Web site.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.720
You tweet.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.070
You play a YouTube video.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.600
You sign up for a user name.

00:24.610 --> 00:30.020
These are all actions we take on Web sites made possible through javascript.

00:30.100 --> 00:36.820
In 1995 it was a way for this browser Netscape to beat the competition which were other browsers at

00:36.820 --> 00:40.660
the time because at the time Netscape was the most popular.

00:40.930 --> 00:45.640
Other browsers started adopting their own version of JavaScript so that Web sites will work on their

00:45.640 --> 00:51.400
browsers as well and thus less people switch over to their browsers.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.570
Can you guess what happened next.

00:53.570 --> 00:58.250
Well every browser had their own idea of what javascript was.

00:58.310 --> 01:00.260
So there was no standard.

01:00.260 --> 01:06.500
Eventually a standard had to be created to make sure that everyone had the same idea of what javascript

01:06.530 --> 01:14.230
was so that web developers can build one Web site and have it work on all browsers.

01:14.230 --> 01:16.240
This standard was called Acme script.

01:16.240 --> 01:23.590
So yes javascript and my script can be used interchangeably and you will hear both of these a lot but

01:23.860 --> 01:26.100
it's the same language.

01:26.200 --> 01:32.890
Now this browser compatibility issue browsers having their own teams their own schedule and their own

01:32.890 --> 01:33.790
code.

01:33.790 --> 01:35.050
Sound familiar.

01:35.890 --> 01:41.910
Yep if you remember it's the same thing that happened with HCM Mel and CSX.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.880
It's the same issue that we keep having over and over.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.580
We cover this topic in web developer fundamental part two.

01:49.750 --> 01:53.600
You see it's always a big problem.

01:53.800 --> 02:01.420
Make sure that all browsers have the same understanding of what our real a shemale see CSX and JavaScript

02:01.420 --> 02:08.640
should be so that when we send each one of those files we don't have to write one specific for each

02:08.640 --> 02:14.630
browser and just like AC million CSX javascript is evolving.

02:14.690 --> 02:21.710
So there are new things that we can do now that you weren't able to do in 1995 with JavaScript in the

02:21.710 --> 02:25.190
E6 video section later on in the course.

02:25.190 --> 02:27.080
We will talk about these new features.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.920
So don't worry.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.060
Now let's take a look at what javascript does.

02:32.060 --> 02:37.570
We can open up the browser and I have you Demi over here.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.250
Well you Demi uses a lot of Javascript.

02:40.260 --> 02:48.580
I mean clicking on a course adding it to cart liking a post all these things.

02:48.590 --> 02:51.690
Well they're all javascript.

02:51.690 --> 02:57.780
Even if you open categories over here you see this dropdown and I can select things and there's actions

02:57.960 --> 03:00.370
constantly happening throughout the Web site.

03:00.630 --> 03:07.640
That's all javascript but it's not just the Web they can use javascript on Instagram.

03:07.850 --> 03:11.780
Well Instagram uses javascript.

03:11.810 --> 03:13.130
What about something else.

03:13.130 --> 03:16.240
Maybe virtual reality.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.570
Yeah you can do that too.

03:17.570 --> 03:24.910
You can do VR VR games VR apps with JavaScript.

03:24.950 --> 03:27.320
That's that's pretty cool what else can javascript do.

03:27.560 --> 03:35.180
Well you can actually program drones with JavaScript and control them from your wee remote.

03:35.180 --> 03:39.220
If you wanted to what about robotics.

03:39.250 --> 03:39.630
Yeah.

03:39.670 --> 03:48.890
This guy built a robot so he can control from his web browser.

03:48.910 --> 03:49.680
How cool is that.

03:51.770 --> 03:58.730
Now remember no J.S. we talked about this slide at the beginning of the course and how we're going to

03:58.730 --> 03:59.660
learn these topics.

03:59.660 --> 04:07.680
Well some of this is able to be done because of it but no G S is pretty much javascript it is javascript.

04:07.760 --> 04:13.640
So you learn Javascript you can pick up back and stuff very easily and then know j a section of this

04:13.640 --> 04:15.320
course will be a breeze.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.680
It's not a new language.

04:16.700 --> 04:21.470
You'll learn so as express so is react.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.160
So this is why javascript is so important.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.350
What we will learn here will take you very far in the rest of your career.

04:28.370 --> 04:34.840
This is one skill that really opens up a lot of possibilities here's the beauty of JavaScript though

04:35.110 --> 04:44.260
and any other programming languages because what is javascript really it's it's a file a file that you

04:44.260 --> 04:46.830
can write instructions to a computer.

04:46.960 --> 04:53.230
In the example of a robot arm all you had to do is write if I press this button move arm to the right.

04:53.230 --> 04:59.040
If I press this button move arm to the left it all looks extremely complicated.

04:59.040 --> 05:05.520
But as you will see no matter how complex a program let's say an online game like World of Warcraft.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.760
Well everything is built one block at a time.

05:08.790 --> 05:15.670
One simple logic at a time in the next section we're going to start writing our first JavaScript in

05:15.670 --> 05:17.930
our first simple pieces of logic.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.740
Don't let a fool you though although it may look simple.

05:20.740 --> 05:27.680
These are the building blocks that allow you to build big web apps like Facebook or Google exciting

05:27.680 --> 05:30.080
things are going to happen with your new found power.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.190
So I'll see you in the next one by.
