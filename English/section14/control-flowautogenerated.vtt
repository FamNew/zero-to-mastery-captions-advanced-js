WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:03.140
And a welcome back.

00:03.150 --> 00:07.770
Hopefully those exercises weren't too tough and you breezed right through them.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.760
We're going to talk about something called control flow.

00:12.860 --> 00:15.840
Up until now we've been doing this.

00:15.950 --> 00:20.110
This little arrow we write a line of code.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.430
Then another line of code then another line of code.

00:22.430 --> 00:28.700
Then another line of code and everything executes in one line just flows.

00:28.700 --> 00:33.050
Just kind of like water if you're pouring water down is just going straight down.

00:33.890 --> 00:37.110
But what if we had conditions.

00:37.190 --> 00:44.270
What if we want to say something like If use your name is Bob say hi Bob.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.930
If not say I don't know you.

00:47.540 --> 00:56.400
Maybe sign in again or we don't have this user that's called conditional execution and it looks something

00:56.400 --> 01:03.450
like this where we get to a point in the program and we have two options where we either want to go

01:03.450 --> 01:11.060
one way or the other and then continue executing so in this lesson we're going to talk about exactly

01:11.060 --> 01:15.130
that Conditional Execution let's try some out

01:19.300 --> 01:21.490
so javascript conditionals.

01:21.730 --> 01:22.840
That's what they're called.

01:22.840 --> 01:30.870
We're going to start off with what's called an if statement and an if statement kind of reads like English

01:31.740 --> 01:33.930
we can do something similar to this.

01:33.960 --> 01:43.470
I say if name equals remember three equals signs here because we're not assigning a variable we're comparing

01:45.280 --> 01:47.410
if name equals Billy

01:49.980 --> 01:51.000
closed the bracket.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.990
And this is just a notation that you'll have to get used to again is just like learning a language.

01:56.130 --> 02:01.740
You just have to know that when you're doing an if statement you have to have these brackets closed

02:01.740 --> 02:08.340
the brackets and then you do curly bracket hold shift and enter so that the program that doesn't execute

02:09.030 --> 02:15.300
and will say I've added a tab just so you can see for indentation I can say alert

02:18.380 --> 02:19.970
Hi Billy

02:23.940 --> 02:32.770
and I closed the bracket and again just like I said each expression something that produces a value

02:33.160 --> 02:37.230
needs to have a semicolon and you might think that you need a semicolon here.

02:37.240 --> 02:45.090
But again with an if statement you don't add one but alert that's an expression we add a semicolon here.

02:45.130 --> 02:51.540
Now you might be asking yourself well we haven't assigned a variable to name yet so let's do that.

02:51.640 --> 02:59.920
I'm going to say name variable name equals.

03:00.110 --> 03:08.650
We'll say Billy and I'm going to press censure let's see what happens High Belly.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.110
OK.

03:09.140 --> 03:12.960
So that looks like it's working just the double check.

03:13.010 --> 03:22.360
What if I change name to Susie looks semicolon not called OK.

03:22.460 --> 03:30.800
And now if we run this program again I'm going to just copy it if name equals Billy alert.

03:30.810 --> 03:34.480
Hi Billy nothing happens.

03:34.620 --> 03:42.010
I just get undefined and no alert so that's a conditional statement.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.120
But let's be realistic here.

03:44.140 --> 03:50.320
You often won't just have code that executes when a condition holds true but also code that handles

03:50.740 --> 03:54.400
other cases such as when the name isn't Billy.

03:54.400 --> 04:05.670
Maybe when the name is Susie so this alternate path is shown if you remember in the diagram by the alternate

04:05.670 --> 04:14.100
arrow we need to have an alternate route in case the name doesn't equal Billy so let's go back again

04:15.060 --> 04:16.560
and see what we can do.

04:16.590 --> 04:28.350
So the second key word that we're going to learn is else so you can do something like If name equals

04:29.320 --> 04:33.030
Billy and I just press right here.

04:33.030 --> 04:41.010
Here again Google Chrome is smart enough to know that you've typed this before and now instead of leaving

04:41.010 --> 04:44.400
it like that I now press space else.

04:44.400 --> 04:50.800
So if Naomi goes belly alert HI BILLY else it kind of reads like English right.

04:51.420 --> 05:05.930
And then again else opening curly bracket closing curly bracket and within here I'm going to say alert.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.830
I don't know you.

05:09.870 --> 05:14.800
So now let's see what happens.

05:14.930 --> 05:15.530
I don't know you.

05:15.530 --> 05:16.160
And why is that.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.990
Because if you remember name you call Susie.

05:20.990 --> 05:23.000
If I change name to

05:26.500 --> 05:26.920
Billy

05:29.990 --> 05:32.300
well and redo the program again.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.270
Hi Billy.

05:34.280 --> 05:42.700
So that's what's called an if else statement you write a condition if something equals true then do

05:42.700 --> 05:46.570
something else do something else.

05:46.570 --> 05:49.110
And this is just a syntax you'll have to learn.

05:49.120 --> 05:55.520
But as you can see it's fairly easy you read it a couple times and you'll get the hang of it OK.

05:55.540 --> 06:05.980
But now you might have another question what if what if you have something like this something a little

06:05.980 --> 06:13.290
bit more complicated like this where you have multiple conditions.

06:13.390 --> 06:14.740
Let's see what I'm talking about.

06:14.770 --> 06:23.890
By showing you another example in this one we're going to use something called else F.

06:23.990 --> 06:30.750
So again I'm going to say f name equals Billy.

06:30.750 --> 06:35.000
Again I'm just going to press the right key here and it's going to load up what I've written before.

06:35.070 --> 06:38.060
So if name equals Billy alert.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.160
Hi Billy.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.940
Else alert.

06:41.980 --> 06:43.510
I don't know.

06:43.510 --> 06:43.960
I don't know.

06:44.050 --> 06:47.410
But what if we also want to check for the name Susie.

06:47.410 --> 06:59.300
Well I can do something like else if name equals Susie close bracket.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.690
I'm going to say

07:04.020 --> 07:12.820
hi Susie and at the end here you can leave it as is or again we can add an else statement.

07:12.830 --> 07:24.220
So with both of these fail both of these comparisons fail I can say else alert.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.190
I don't know you

07:28.970 --> 07:34.820
close the bracket again don't forget to close and close the bracket press enter and says Hi Billy.

07:34.820 --> 07:39.030
Because remember my name is Billy.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.400
But if I do name equals Susie

07:45.510 --> 07:51.040
and I rerun the program again press the Cherokee and I press enter again.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.610
Hi Susie that's pretty cool right.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.330
You can think of this counting how passwords work right.

07:58.330 --> 08:04.750
This is what forms are doing they're checking your e-mail and checking your password using simple logic

08:04.750 --> 08:06.630
like this.

08:06.650 --> 08:13.880
Now I want to show you also with conditionals what's very useful and that's something called logical

08:14.180 --> 08:15.660
operators.

08:15.770 --> 08:20.290
I'm going to show you the three of them if I can on comment this.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.100
There you go.

08:21.200 --> 08:27.450
And these are the three so let's clean this up and try something.

08:27.620 --> 08:33.830
I can go if name equals Billy

08:37.390 --> 08:43.460
or these two lines so it's right above your enter key.

08:43.680 --> 08:50.580
This means or in JavaScript for name equals an

08:54.360 --> 08:57.820
then alert

09:01.460 --> 09:04.030
hi billy or an

09:07.210 --> 09:08.570
closer bracket.

09:08.650 --> 09:09.740
What do you think will happen here.

09:10.090 --> 09:10.730
Let's see.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.910
Name equals

09:20.400 --> 09:21.690
re execute the program.

09:23.220 --> 09:26.060
Press enter again.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.200
Hi Billy or n.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.900
But if now the name is

09:32.710 --> 09:36.980
Han and I re execute the program press enter again.

09:37.090 --> 09:46.440
Hi Billy or an that's that's pretty cool I can do or comparison what's another one that we can do.

09:46.650 --> 09:57.860
Well we can also do and which is two of these sites and this means if name equals Billy and name equals

09:58.000 --> 10:01.760
and let's see if this works.

10:01.930 --> 10:09.720
No let's to name equals N and we do the program and I'm not getting anything What if I do Billy

10:14.260 --> 10:15.340
and execute.

10:15.370 --> 10:16.780
No nothing.

10:16.780 --> 10:17.540
Why is that.

10:17.540 --> 10:20.320
Well this doesn't make sense right.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.310
I mean name equals Billy and name equals.

10:24.310 --> 10:30.680
And but as we've discussed a variable holds well holds a value.

10:30.730 --> 10:36.430
It's a drawer in your desk and it has a certain type of look to it.

10:36.430 --> 10:43.620
It either has a pen or a bunch of files it can have both billion and a lease.

10:43.630 --> 10:52.520
Now with what we've learned so far so this doesn't make sense where you would use end is maybe to check

10:52.520 --> 10:54.730
somebodies name so I can do.

10:54.850 --> 11:14.360
If first name remember I'm using camel case here Bob Dent last name equals Smith closer bracket curly

11:14.360 --> 11:14.860
brackets.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.790
I'm going to say alert.

11:16.790 --> 11:24.760
Hi Bob Smith closer brackets curly brackets press enter.

11:25.190 --> 11:29.880
And looks like I made a mistake here and it says first name is not defined.

11:29.880 --> 11:35.000
And while that's true because I've never said what first name is and last name this before I've already

11:35.000 --> 11:36.510
defined what name was.

11:36.980 --> 11:43.970
But it needs to know what these variables are otherwise saying hey I'm javascript and I've never encountered

11:43.970 --> 11:46.340
these words before where are you talking about.

11:46.340 --> 12:00.260
So before we do this we have to say variable first name equals Bob and variable last name equals

12:05.830 --> 12:06.670
OK.

12:06.740 --> 12:12.140
I actually want to draw your attention back to the air you'll get this a lot when you're starting off

12:12.560 --> 12:15.370
reference their first name is not defined.

12:15.380 --> 12:21.830
It's pretty good air but keep that in mind reference area just means I I don't know what this value

12:21.830 --> 12:28.210
is it's not referencing anything OK so now that we have first name and last name defined we press up

12:28.210 --> 12:33.880
again to get to our little execution piece here and I go press enter again.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.130
Hi Bob Smith.

12:35.260 --> 12:47.100
If I change the first name or last name to say JONES PRESENTER And let's re execute this piece of code

12:48.440 --> 12:56.670
I get nothing because first name and last name must match OK I have one last one over here and that's

12:56.670 --> 13:01.260
the exclamation point or exclamation mark not point.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.460
Let's see what it does.

13:03.520 --> 13:07.070
This is a little bit tricky but see if you can follow along here.

13:07.360 --> 13:31.280
If exclamation mark name equals Bob opening brackets alert Hi Bob and close the press enter and I get.

13:31.470 --> 13:32.280
Bob.

13:32.850 --> 13:37.390
OK let's remember one name was it's Billy.

13:37.390 --> 13:48.720
Why am I getting high Bob when Billy's the name clearly name doesn't equal Bob because of this.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.690
This is the not operator.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.590
So it's the opposite.

13:54.710 --> 14:05.010
So it turns this expression which is name equals Bob which is false to true so just to show you if I

14:05.010 --> 14:14.730
go this and then false I get true and if I go this true I get false.

14:14.730 --> 14:24.360
So that's why I use the brackets here I'm saying evaluate this and once you do this add the opposite

14:24.900 --> 14:31.170
to not and it seems like why would I ever want to do that.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.840
When would I ever use this.

14:32.880 --> 14:40.200
And this is a good thing to use whenever let's say you want to turn off a switch.

14:40.200 --> 14:45.040
So just like I showed you if I go not true I can say now it's off.

14:45.270 --> 14:48.510
Not false light comes on.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.860
So you'll see cases when we do use this.

14:51.990 --> 14:57.420
And I promise you it's very very very important that we have it in the language.

14:57.420 --> 15:05.610
So let's just review what we've learned up to this point so that in the next video we have a sense of

15:05.700 --> 15:11.430
where we've been and where we've got we've talked about JavaScript types we've learned about numbers

15:11.760 --> 15:16.510
strings billions and undefined.

15:16.530 --> 15:23.460
We've also learned about JavaScript comparisons that we use sometimes in conditional statements like

15:23.460 --> 15:24.720
if statements.

15:24.720 --> 15:32.530
We've learned about JavaScript variables we've learned about JavaScript conditionals that if else else

15:32.560 --> 15:40.420
if statements and we've learned about JavaScript logical operators these and or and exclamation marks

15:40.790 --> 15:42.810
and there's a few more that we haven't covered yet.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.780
And don't worry we will.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.320
I know this is confusing.

15:46.320 --> 15:53.740
This is new syntax it's learning a new language but it's not too bad.

15:53.890 --> 15:57.570
It definitely doesn't have as many words as a real language.

15:57.640 --> 16:02.980
You just have to get used to this and practice typing in the console and practice with the problems

16:03.040 --> 16:10.140
and get yourself familiar with running these syntax is and it will click and it'll become second nature.

16:10.150 --> 16:13.720
Like I said everybody goes through this you'll get it.

16:13.810 --> 16:19.210
I promise I know I keep saying this but I only say because I know when I started learning this stuff

16:19.750 --> 16:25.300
that's how I felt and and that's how everybody else feels so I want to just make sure that don't worry

16:25.420 --> 16:30.790
you'll get there you're gonna be a master of JavaScript by the end of this course so I'll see you on

16:30.790 --> 16:31.910
the next one.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.980
Can't wait to show you more.

16:34.090 --> 16:35.280
Talk to you then.

16:35.350 --> 16:35.650
Bye bye.
