I want to show you one little diagram to finalize this point.

00:08.370 --> 00:15.950
When a function is called an environment is created for the new scope that it enters.

00:15.990 --> 00:16.580
Right.

00:16.680 --> 00:25.950
This little world that it enters that environment has a field that has its own variable environment

00:26.280 --> 00:34.120
but also another place that points to the outer scope and then that outer scope points to its outer

00:34.120 --> 00:43.630
scope until it hits the global scope and the javascript spec actually has this internally where its

00:43.690 --> 00:49.180
bracket bracket or square brackets square brackets scope or scopes.

00:49.240 --> 00:58.120
So let's test out this idea now in Google Chrome developer browser you can actually access this property.

00:58.390 --> 01:09.760
If I create a function here let's just call it a if I go into the window object now and look for a Let's

01:09.770 --> 01:13.710
scroll down there it is by click over here.

01:13.970 --> 01:22.100
I HAVE A FEW THINGS BUT IF I GO DOWN LOOK AT THAT I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED scopes and inside of the Scopes

01:23.060 --> 01:26.000
we have type global.

01:26.000 --> 01:26.900
Why.

01:26.900 --> 01:34.770
Well because the scope of function a that scope is global.

01:34.830 --> 01:38.880
So this is pointing to the outer parent.

01:39.390 --> 01:43.880
So we have our variable environments in function a.

01:44.160 --> 01:51.210
And as soon as we can't find what we're looking for we're going to look inside of scopes to our outer

01:51.210 --> 01:58.260
environment which in this case is the global type which is the window object.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.900
Very very cool.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.200
All right it's time to do a fun little exercise.
