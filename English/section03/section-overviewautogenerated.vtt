00:00.750 --> 00:05.520
It is time to get into the weeds of JavaScript by writing some code.

00:05.520 --> 00:12.090
Finally we're going to be coding along to understand the fundamental principles of the language and

00:12.090 --> 00:15.410
we will continue to do so for the rest of this course.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.280
Hurray I know everybody's happy.

00:17.370 --> 00:18.870
No more staring at slides.

00:18.870 --> 00:22.910
I mean we're still gonna have slides but don't worry we'll get some coding done too.

00:23.100 --> 00:29.460
In this section we're going to speak about things that underlie the way the language works and the topics

00:29.460 --> 00:34.230
that come up again and again for senior javascript developer interviews.

00:34.470 --> 00:42.150
By the end of this section you will know what each of these terms meet but also be able to use this

00:42.150 --> 00:47.730
to your advantage to analyze code to write better code and just a heads up.

00:47.880 --> 00:53.730
You're going to learn some words in here that sound a lot more complex than they really are.

00:53.730 --> 00:55.280
However they're important.

00:55.290 --> 01:00.360
And by the end of this section you should feel comfortable discussing them and using them when speaking

01:00.360 --> 01:01.200
about code.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.080
So enough talk let's get started.

01:04.110 --> 01:04.960
I'll see you in the next one.

01:05.430 --> 01:05.790
Bye bye.
