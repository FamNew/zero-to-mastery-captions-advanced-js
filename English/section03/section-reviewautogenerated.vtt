00:00.600 --> 00:02.550
Holy moly.

00:02.550 --> 00:06.780
Finally done with the foundations.

00:06.780 --> 00:10.500
We're gonna get to some exciting parts but what do we learn so far.

00:11.460 --> 00:19.570
Well we learned how the JavaScript engine and the compilers and how a language is read and execute it

00:19.590 --> 00:20.350
right.

00:20.430 --> 00:28.530
And then once a language like Javascript is executed we learned about execution context how every function

00:28.560 --> 00:31.440
invocation creates an execution context.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.330
We learned about lexical environment where we write our code is important.

00:36.330 --> 00:43.580
We learned about the scope chain a way for us to look for variables and see what we have access to.

00:43.590 --> 00:50.610
We learned about an interesting feature that is hoisting how javascript does this weird thing that hoists

00:50.820 --> 00:57.920
function declarations and variable declarations we learned about function invocation and some of the

00:57.920 --> 01:05.100
interesting properties when we create new functions such as getting the arguments parameter or sometimes

01:05.130 --> 01:07.490
even modifying the this keyword.

01:07.800 --> 01:14.370
We learned about function scope and block scope and how in JavaScript originally we only had function

01:14.370 --> 01:20.820
scope but with the new let and const keywords we can use some block scoping.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.290
We learned about dynamic and lexical scope how javascript just has lexical scope except for this little

01:28.290 --> 01:37.500
thing called the this keyword that has dynamic scoping that is it gets determined what the this value

01:37.500 --> 01:40.970
is when the function is invoked.

01:41.010 --> 01:50.210
We also learned how to master this keyword the benefits of having this keyword how to use call apply

01:50.210 --> 01:56.770
and bind and we also learned about immediately invoked function expressions.

01:56.770 --> 02:04.060
Now especially these two this and the if this is something we're going to talk about later on in the

02:04.060 --> 02:09.550
course so we just scratched the surface with these things.

02:09.550 --> 02:16.720
But by now you should have the foundations of JavaScript done and we learned some really complex topics

02:17.020 --> 02:20.470
that really make you a great programmer.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.220
I hope you are having fun.

02:22.270 --> 02:28.040
I know that was a tough big section but trust me things are gonna get better and better.

02:28.180 --> 02:34.720
And as we progress through the course you'll see how the foundations that we've laid out are gonna help

02:34.720 --> 02:40.210
you expand and learn and become better and better as we progress through the course.

02:40.210 --> 02:44.510
So don't give up just yet because we have lots more to go through.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.090
I'll see you the next one.

02:46.090 --> 02:46.570
Bye bye.
