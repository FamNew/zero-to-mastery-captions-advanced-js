Welcome back.

00:01.660 --> 00:11.070
I wanted to have a quick video to clarify a term here and that is context versus scope scope is a function

00:11.160 --> 00:13.710
based thing right.

00:13.710 --> 00:20.280
Scope means what is the variable access of a function when it is invoked.

00:20.550 --> 00:25.960
What is in the variable environment right context.

00:26.110 --> 00:36.400
On the other hand is more about object based context says what's the value of this keyword.

00:36.640 --> 00:45.210
Which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code so Context and scope is something

00:45.210 --> 00:50.150
that people get confused between and especially when we start talking about context execution as well.

00:50.160 --> 00:57.240
It gets a little bit confusing but just keep this in mind context is most often determined by how a

00:57.240 --> 01:05.940
function is invoked with the value of this keyword and scope refers to the visibility of variables.

01:06.020 --> 01:07.870
All right I'll see in the next one.

01:08.000 --> 01:08.220
Bye.
