Welcome back let's explore how we can create our own prototypes because I told you that promo is something

00:11.020 --> 00:12.200
that we shouldn't use.

00:12.220 --> 00:20.890
We should never do proton equals some type of an object because we should never use this for performance

00:20.890 --> 00:24.150
reasons in our javascript code.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.980
So what is a safe way to do this.

00:26.980 --> 00:38.030
Well let's create a human and this human will have a property that is well mortal.

00:38.230 --> 00:42.150
A human is mortal should be true.

00:42.430 --> 00:51.160
And let's say out of that human we create let's say Socrates and Socrates should also be a human it

00:51.160 --> 00:57.180
should inherit from this human and we can do that with object dot create.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.210
Now there are many ways of doing this.

00:59.230 --> 01:06.910
Something that we'll explore in the upcoming section but this is one of the ways that we can inherit

01:07.540 --> 01:14.510
from human so that I created object does create human.

01:14.650 --> 01:24.770
And that's going to equal Socrates so that if I do console dialogue Socrates and I run well I get an

01:24.770 --> 01:37.500
empty object let's add a property on Socrates let's say Socrates has let's say age of forty five.

01:37.550 --> 01:44.480
I don't know how old Socrates was but let's say forty five and if I run this I have age forty five but

01:45.350 --> 01:57.920
can I do Socrates thought mortal if I click Run yep I have it Socrates is mortal because we've created

01:58.250 --> 02:12.300
using object to create a prototype chain up to human so if I do human dot is a prototype of Socrates

02:12.960 --> 02:22.730
we all get true human is prototype of Socrates we've inherited from human not bad at all.

02:22.900 --> 02:28.030
This is something we're going to explore a little bit more like I said before but for now at least now

02:28.030 --> 02:34.270
you know how to do this without using that evil underscore underscore product as a matter of fact they

02:34.360 --> 02:42.580
named it this way so that nobody accidentally messes with the prototype chain I'll see in the next one.

02:43.080 --> 02:43.190
