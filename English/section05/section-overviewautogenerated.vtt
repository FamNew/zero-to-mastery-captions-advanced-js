00:01.170 --> 00:06.100
We finally made it to another important section in this course.

00:06.240 --> 00:14.000
The two pillars in this section we're going to be talking about what I think are the two of the most

00:14.000 --> 00:18.670
important concepts in JavaScript and also the most powerful.

00:18.980 --> 00:26.030
These two powers that we're going to learn are also quite unique and not available in all languages

00:26.810 --> 00:34.810
but it's also why it makes javascript so powerful if you understand these two topics that we're going

00:34.810 --> 00:39.260
to talk about that you're truly going to evolve as a programmer.

00:39.450 --> 00:44.400
If you want to be considered a senior javascript developer you have to know inside and out.

00:44.850 --> 00:47.450
So what are these special skills.

00:47.460 --> 00:55.710
It's right here closures and prototype all inheritance if you worked with JavaScript before then for

00:55.710 --> 01:02.520
sure you've heard of these terms but they're pretty advanced especially if you want to deeply understand

01:02.520 --> 01:04.830
them which we're going gonna do in this section.

01:04.830 --> 01:11.460
But before we dive into these two pillars we're going to quickly talk about some of the below topics

01:11.790 --> 01:13.130
right over here.

01:13.500 --> 01:22.090
High order functions and functions versus objects in order to truly understand these concepts and once

01:22.180 --> 01:28.420
we have all of that in place and we talk a little bit about the birth of JavaScript and how scheme and

01:28.420 --> 01:35.290
Java where inspirational to Brendan Knight when he created javascript what we're going to learn here

01:35.650 --> 01:41.670
and the two pillars is going to allow us to really move on to object oriented programming.

01:41.860 --> 01:50.040
Functional programming to really start using what we've learned to make ourselves a better programmer.

01:50.050 --> 01:54.100
So let's get started and I'll see in the next video by.
