Welcome back.

00:02.130 --> 00:04.130
Here's another exercise for you.

00:05.160 --> 00:10.460
And here's a hint there's actually two ways of solving this problem.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.090
So let's see if we can find both solutions.

00:14.310 --> 00:21.060
And I'm using this question because it has to be one of the most commonly asked interview questions

00:21.060 --> 00:22.710
for JavaScript developers.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.630
So hopefully you're able to understand it.

00:25.710 --> 00:35.550
I have an array here and also a loop over this array so we're just looping over the array and we're

00:35.550 --> 00:37.470
running a set time out.

00:37.530 --> 00:46.080
So we're calling that web API and we have a callback function right here that will be called in three

00:46.080 --> 00:56.840
seconds that will console log I am at index of my SO if I click Run here what's going to happen.

00:56.850 --> 01:00.770
Well let's find out when I click Run.

01:00.830 --> 01:04.430
I'm waiting for set time out and it's back.

01:04.430 --> 01:11.780
I am at index 4 for 4 for is that what you expected.

01:13.100 --> 01:13.940
If there wasn't.

01:13.980 --> 01:25.960
Look at the function carefully and see if we can fix this so that I logs 1 2 3 4 and I'll see in the

01:25.960 --> 01:26.590
solution video.
