00:00.930 --> 00:01.980
Welcome back.

00:01.980 --> 00:04.990
Let's do another exercise now.

00:05.010 --> 00:09.260
We learned all about prototype ball inheritance here.

00:09.390 --> 00:18.000
So based on what you know plus all the things that we've learned in the past like the this keyword using

00:18.060 --> 00:24.300
all that knowledge I have two questions here that I'm going to warn you are a little bit difficult.

00:24.450 --> 00:25.830
You might not get them.

00:25.860 --> 00:32.210
You might have to google around and search around and remember there's no such thing as a perfect programmer.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.800
We can know everything.

00:33.810 --> 00:39.420
So use Google if you need to and especially the last one is pretty tough.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.840
So you can always come back to it but give it a go.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.400
And in the next video I'll show you how we solve these problems.

00:48.420 --> 00:56.400
The first question is I want you to create using the Date object that we have in JavaScript right here.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.930
That simply gives us a date.

01:01.010 --> 01:05.960
I want you to add a new method onto this constructor.

01:05.960 --> 01:13.400
This date constructor that is called Last year javascript doesn't have this.

01:13.400 --> 01:21.990
If I run this code I get last year is not a function because well that's not a thing if I do get a year

01:22.230 --> 01:23.460
or get full year.

01:23.580 --> 01:29.700
We see the types of methods that we have with a date object.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.150
But unfortunately last year well we don't have that.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.610
We're going to want to create it ourself.

01:34.650 --> 01:37.080
So how would you go about doing that.

01:37.200 --> 01:43.500
If I give it let's say a string like this date suggests nineteen hundred.

01:43.500 --> 01:51.480
If I do last year it'll give me the year before in the year a year year year format.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.680
So the answer to this will be 18 19.

01:55.380 --> 02:03.520
If this was let's say just new date with nothing in here which will give us the current date this should

02:03.520 --> 02:08.590
give us well last year so how do you do that.

02:08.890 --> 02:11.660
And then the second part and this is the bonus one.

02:11.860 --> 02:21.760
How can we modify the map method that we have on a race to print a actual map emoji at the end of each

02:22.030 --> 02:23.100
item.

02:23.350 --> 02:25.790
Middle of a spelling error there.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.920
So that if I do let's say console log and I give it an array.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.100
One two three.

02:30.300 --> 02:38.020
And then I do dot map and not give it anything I will actually print out one two three.

02:38.030 --> 02:44.310
But with the maps next to it how could we do that.

02:44.350 --> 02:50.610
Can we modify what these built in methods by javascript do.

02:50.650 --> 02:51.310
Give it a go.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.430
And in the next video I'll give you the answers.

02:54.490 --> 02:54.870
Good luck.
