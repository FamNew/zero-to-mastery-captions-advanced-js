00:00.720 --> 00:09.330
What does advanced JavaScript mean everyone has a different idea of what advanced needs in order to

00:09.330 --> 00:12.240
make sure that the course can be enjoyed by everybody.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.840
I have structured the course in a unique way so that although everyone will start at different levels

00:18.900 --> 00:23.740
of knowledge you will all end up at the same place in the end.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.450
Let's have a look.

00:25.820 --> 00:34.520
This is our course outline and the course starts off with the foundations to make sure that we have

00:34.520 --> 00:38.590
those building blocks in place to learn best practices.

00:38.780 --> 00:46.130
Advanced topics and how to write clean code will start diving quite deep into things like the JavaScript

00:46.160 --> 00:53.270
engine the runtime talking about interpreters compilers JIT compilers going to talk about all these

00:53.270 --> 00:54.230
topics.

00:54.230 --> 00:59.450
Some of them quite advanced and then dive deep into the language itself.

00:59.450 --> 01:04.550
Talking about some of the key terms that you may have heard but not fully understood like execution

01:04.550 --> 01:09.760
context lexical environment dynamic versus lexical scope.

01:10.130 --> 01:17.300
And once we're done with the foundations and we are for sure ready for more advanced topics we start

01:17.300 --> 01:19.900
getting into types in JavaScript.

01:20.120 --> 01:27.140
Talking about statically versus dynamically typed languages about type caution passed by reference past

01:27.140 --> 01:31.260
by value and then we're going to talk about something really important.

01:31.400 --> 01:39.260
The two pillars something that really makes javascript powerful and these two pillars are going to be.

01:39.260 --> 01:42.110
Closures and prototype all inheritance.

01:42.110 --> 01:48.410
Now you may know these topics but we're gonna go dive deep and understand why these two topics are really

01:48.410 --> 01:51.520
powerful and making us a great program.

01:52.040 --> 01:52.920
Along the way.

01:52.920 --> 01:59.240
We're going to talk about some other topics as well but all of this is for us to be set up to talk about

01:59.630 --> 02:01.710
the programming paradigms.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.520
This is where it gets fun.

02:04.160 --> 02:12.800
We take all the knowledge that we have built up until now to talk about ways to structure our code organize

02:12.800 --> 02:15.830
our code and write beautiful programs.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.910
We're going to talk about the two main ways to structure our code.

02:20.060 --> 02:23.430
One is object oriented programming and the other one.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.460
Functional programming.

02:25.460 --> 02:31.700
And we're going to dive deep and talk about each of these topics and also talk about composition versus

02:31.730 --> 02:32.770
inheritance.

02:32.960 --> 02:40.040
By the end of it you're going to learn some paradigms that have taken years and years decades for programmers

02:40.310 --> 02:46.520
to learn what these good practices are and to end it all off.

02:46.610 --> 02:52.760
I have some extra sections to go beyond and learn about important topics like asynchronous javascript

02:53.150 --> 02:59.870
modules and JavaScript and go over the history of modules and also a topic that often gets forgotten

02:59.870 --> 03:03.240
about error handling and how to properly do it.

03:03.890 --> 03:07.410
And there might be a small data structure section as well.

03:07.550 --> 03:15.240
In the end all of this is a path for you to become a top 10 percent javascript developer.

03:15.260 --> 03:21.680
The idea is that we're starting off with building our pyramid with the fundamentals and going up that

03:21.680 --> 03:24.300
pyramid each step of the way.

03:24.440 --> 03:30.380
If on one of the videos you find the topic too hard or too advanced I have included an appendix section

03:30.680 --> 03:34.790
which teaches you the basic javascript topics for a beginner.

03:34.790 --> 03:40.760
This way no matter what your level you have a way to learn from each of the videos and reference an

03:40.790 --> 03:42.350
easier video in the appendix.

03:42.350 --> 03:49.520
If you need more explanation for advanced programmers some of the beginning sections may seem too easy

03:49.520 --> 03:55.580
for you but I recommend you hang in there as each section builds on top of the other and you will learn

03:55.580 --> 03:56.720
things along the way.

03:57.020 --> 04:00.550
I promised now to get the most out of this course.

04:00.590 --> 04:07.150
You should follow the lessons in order since you may gain an insight or two even if you thought I'll

04:07.160 --> 04:08.290
leave me alone andre.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.710
I already know this stuff.

04:10.710 --> 04:18.950
OK now that you have an idea of the outline let's talk about what it means to succeed in this course.

04:18.950 --> 04:25.290
First make sure you use our online discourse community to communicate with fellow students.

04:25.310 --> 04:27.230
It's like a classroom.

04:27.230 --> 04:28.220
Ask questions.

04:28.220 --> 04:32.010
Do coding challenges talk about coding exercises.

04:32.180 --> 04:37.670
When it comes to programming there's nothing better than asking questions and helping others.

04:37.670 --> 04:44.030
This is the most active developer community on udemy with over a thousand developers online at any one

04:44.030 --> 04:46.690
time too.

04:46.870 --> 04:52.280
Anytime you feel like you're just watching a video and aren't understanding a topic.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.660
Stop what you are doing take a break and come back to a problem.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.850
You won't be able to finish this course in one week.

05:00.020 --> 05:04.520
If you do it properly it will take you about a month to finish everything.

05:04.610 --> 05:05.890
So take your time.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.780
This isn't a sprint it's a marathon.

05:08.780 --> 05:13.160
Finally try to complete the full course instead of just parts of it.

05:13.160 --> 05:19.580
Most lessons are tied into one another so that they flow and we keep building this pyramid of knowledge.

05:19.580 --> 05:26.440
We will start from the very basic and go into more and more advanced topics all right enough talk.

05:26.910 --> 05:32.430
I think it's time for us to start the course and get ready to be considered a top 10 percent javascript

05:32.700 --> 05:33.960
developer.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.480
Let's get started and see you in the next section.
