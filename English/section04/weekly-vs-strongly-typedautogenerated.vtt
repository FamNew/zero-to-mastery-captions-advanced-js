Let's talk about strong and weak typing and a lot of people tend to use these terms interchangeably.

00:10.500 --> 00:16.830
That is they tend to say oh a dynamic languages weakly typed in a static language is strongly typed

00:16.890 --> 00:21.960
which simply isn't the case as you can see here on the graph.

00:21.960 --> 00:28.050
You can have a weak language that is statically type and a strong language that is dynamically typed

00:29.380 --> 00:36.850
so let's make this clear javascript is a dynamic language or dynamically typed language that is weakly

00:36.880 --> 00:37.790
typed.

00:37.870 --> 00:38.470
What does that mean.

00:39.370 --> 00:43.550
Well in javascript I can do this in javascript.

00:43.550 --> 00:54.860
I can say variable A equals Booyah and then I can go ahead and say A plus 17

00:57.740 --> 01:01.330
Booyah with 17.

01:01.470 --> 01:07.170
That's what a weekly type language does.

01:07.170 --> 01:15.510
Javascript says you're crazy you're you're trying to add a string to 17.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.120
I think I know what you're trying to do.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.580
I think you're just trying to add 17 to booyah.

01:20.610 --> 01:29.130
So I'm just going to turn this 17 number into a string and do this and this is often called type caution

01:29.430 --> 01:36.270
in JavaScript and it can lead to some unintended consequences and a lot of people get annoyed at javascript

01:36.420 --> 01:44.590
for this feature because in a strongly typed language you can't do this.

01:44.770 --> 01:53.010
For example in Python you can see that it's dynamic but strongly typed if we write some python code

01:54.390 --> 01:58.430
let's say I'll do and I'm just gonna use python here.

01:58.470 --> 01:59.870
Ignore the syntax.

01:59.940 --> 02:05.090
So let's say variable is equal to booyah.

02:05.100 --> 02:20.790
Again and then I'll do a or variable plus 17 here well this is actually going to throw an error in python

02:21.210 --> 02:25.650
because it's going to say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you crazy guy.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.080
This is you're trying to add string and numbers.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.550
That that doesn't work.

02:29.700 --> 02:34.990
And it's kind of throw an error because it's strongly typed.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.340
All right.

02:35.360 --> 02:41.630
I hope that illustrates the point nicely for you now there are once again pros and cons to doing this

02:41.870 --> 02:44.450
but this is beyond the scope of this course.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.880
If you really want to get into it and trust me there's tons of information out there because people

02:49.880 --> 02:53.810
are so strongly opinionated about these topics.

02:53.810 --> 03:00.530
I do recommend checking them out going on Google and typing strong versus weakly typed.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.840
Let's get back on track here to our main topic that is typescript.

03:05.060 --> 03:11.330
How can we add typescript to make javascript type safe.

03:11.330 --> 03:14.960
All right I'm going to leave you in suspense.

03:14.970 --> 03:17.060
I'll see you in the next video by.
