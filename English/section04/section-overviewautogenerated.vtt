00:00.910 --> 00:01.570
Welcome back.

00:01.570 --> 00:06.710
And good job getting this far in the course where in this part a tiny little part.

00:06.730 --> 00:12.340
Before we get into the two pillars of JavaScript a really really fun topic that I'm excited about.

00:12.670 --> 00:15.970
But first we have to get through this part.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.770
Now all programming languages have types.

00:20.820 --> 00:25.290
That is the building blocks that allow us to write in that language.

00:25.290 --> 00:31.660
We can have numbers strings billions and many more and in programming.

00:31.660 --> 00:38.520
There are two types of languages dynamically and statically typed languages.

00:38.740 --> 00:46.500
In this short section we're going to be talking all about types and the idea of types we're going to

00:46.500 --> 00:50.420
define what static versus dynamically typed means.

00:50.730 --> 00:56.610
We're going to talk about primitive types passed by reference versus past by value.

00:56.610 --> 01:01.870
We're going to talk about a very confusing topic in JavaScript type caution.

01:02.190 --> 01:07.830
And we're also going to talk a little bit about arrays functions and objects and how they relate into

01:07.830 --> 01:12.470
this whole ecosystem of types in JavaScript.

01:12.500 --> 01:17.540
This is an important stepping stone in order for us to master the language.

01:17.540 --> 01:20.150
So let's dive in and gain some new knowledge.

01:20.390 --> 01:22.050
I'll see in the next one by.
