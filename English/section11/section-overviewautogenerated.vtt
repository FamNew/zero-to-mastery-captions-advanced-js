Let's talk about errors and that is error handling now errors or what others may call exceptions.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.520
In programming is a seldomly taught topic.

00:14.660 --> 00:20.570
Most people think that if you are a good programmer it means you shouldn't have any errors in your code.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.600
You don't have to even worry about them.

00:22.700 --> 00:30.400
However handling errors is an important skill in becoming a great developer because no matter what.

00:30.480 --> 00:38.750
There is no such thing as a perfect program we need to stop thinking about errors as mistakes and instead

00:38.900 --> 00:47.070
start thinking of errors as a feature a feature for us to improve our code and tell the user or the

00:47.070 --> 00:54.410
programmer when something is wrong and also possibly even telling him how to fix this error.

00:54.810 --> 01:03.150
So remember errors aren't mistakes but rather a feature therefore handling error is a way for us to

01:03.150 --> 01:05.610
become better programmers.

01:05.610 --> 01:06.240
Let's get started.
