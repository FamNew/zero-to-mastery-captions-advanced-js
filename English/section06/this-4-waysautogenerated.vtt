Welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:08.940
If you've been following along each video one by one and you're finally here I hope that the this keyword

00:08.970 --> 00:11.400
is something not scary anymore.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.320
You understand it.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.820
You have a good idea of it.

00:14.100 --> 00:22.850
And I want to take this opportunity to review the ways that we've learned we can manipulate this keyword.

00:22.920 --> 00:33.960
The most recent one that we learned was this idea of the new binding and this new binding was used with

00:33.960 --> 00:38.900
constructor functions where we'd have things like a person.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.850
And we can use this dot.

00:40.850 --> 00:44.450
Name equals name.

00:44.450 --> 00:57.780
This dot age equals page and as soon as we call this and do Person 1 equals new person and we give it

00:57.810 --> 00:59.220
let's say Xavier

01:03.830 --> 01:05.760
and fifty five.

01:05.770 --> 01:07.980
Well now we have Person 1

01:12.450 --> 01:21.990
with the proper this updated the new binding allow us to assign this to the object that we instantiate

01:22.380 --> 01:22.980
the person from.

01:23.190 --> 01:27.090
So Person 1 will be the this keyword.

01:27.690 --> 01:31.290
So that's the one way that we can manipulate this keyword.

01:32.310 --> 01:38.220
The other way is called implicit binding and with implicit binding.

01:38.340 --> 01:47.600
Well it's when we used something like this where it was just implied we didn't have to do anything.

01:47.610 --> 01:50.670
This is just how the language works.

01:50.670 --> 01:58.770
We created an object and inside of that object the this keyword will refer to person.

01:58.890 --> 02:00.830
That's implicit binding.

02:00.930 --> 02:09.130
It's the most common one but then we also learned about X plus it binding.

02:09.480 --> 02:15.780
And that's when we dictate exactly what the this keyword should refer to.

02:15.820 --> 02:26.830
For example if we have person three here with name H and again the same function high function but that

02:27.010 --> 02:32.770
function has let's say set timeout that it wants to call.

02:32.770 --> 02:36.850
But in this case this is going to refer to Person 3.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.650
Just like we saw above.

02:38.740 --> 02:43.170
But let's say that we want to call the set timeout method.

02:43.450 --> 02:49.200
And I mean we could just do window or just not use anything and just to set timeout.

02:49.360 --> 02:58.990
But if we want this to refer to the window object we can explicitly tell it what to bind to and we say

02:59.050 --> 03:06.820
bind to window so that if I do person three dot high

03:09.950 --> 03:18.050
this works I get the set timeout functionality from the window explicit binding is using bind call or

03:18.050 --> 03:26.840
apply to explicitly tell the program hey this is what I want this to be I want it to be window and then

03:26.840 --> 03:37.220
finally we learned about Arrow functions and with Arrow functions we learned that unlike all the other

03:37.220 --> 03:45.530
times where this is dynamically scoped that is it gets determined whenever it gets called with the arrow

03:45.530 --> 03:51.920
functions we can do lexical scoping that is wherever we write the function that's what this binds to

03:53.150 --> 03:59.900
so that if we do something like person for and we have the high function but inside of that function

03:59.960 --> 04:07.550
we have a another function remember a method with a function inside of it is the biggest gotcha when

04:07.550 --> 04:09.170
it comes to this.

04:09.170 --> 04:17.780
Well if we run inner here and we run it everything is working because we're using arrow functions if

04:17.780 --> 04:26.070
we didn't use an arrow function and just used a regular function well in that case this would be the

04:26.070 --> 04:34.880
window object which we usually never want so I hope this is now easier for you to understand error functions

04:34.940 --> 04:42.410
explicit binding implicit binding the new binding allow us to harness the power of this I'll see in

04:42.410 --> 04:43.720
the next one by.
