00:00.780 --> 00:01.770
There you go.

00:01.770 --> 00:02.470
You did it.

00:02.490 --> 00:09.490
You just finish the Object Oriented Programming section of the course we can finally jump into functional

00:09.490 --> 00:13.660
programming and then talking about composition versus inheritance.

00:13.720 --> 00:19.120
And then finally comparing Object Oriented Programming with functional programming when to use what

00:19.470 --> 00:26.140
and some of the pros and cons but in this section we learn some really interesting things we learned

00:26.140 --> 00:33.220
about the this keyword the new keyword we learnt all about prototypes but also how we can simplify things

00:33.340 --> 00:35.610
using ESL classes.

00:35.770 --> 00:43.810
We learned about languages that are class based like Java and C++ but we also learn how JavaScript can

00:44.020 --> 00:50.760
become a language that works with classes although it uses prototype all inheritance.

00:50.890 --> 00:57.390
It can still create classes and act like an object oriented paradigm.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.160
We also learn object does create for those that want to avoid using classes.

01:02.170 --> 01:03.580
There are ways around it.

01:04.010 --> 01:09.970
And we also learned about private versus public fields something that JavaScript is definitely working

01:09.970 --> 01:13.770
towards and will be important as the language grows.

01:13.770 --> 01:21.100
And in order to really solidify the object oriented principles speaking of principles we covered the

01:21.100 --> 01:29.110
four principles of object oriented programming encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism

01:30.430 --> 01:37.870
and at the end of it all we learned how this programming paradigm allows us to structure our code beyond

01:37.870 --> 01:45.940
just simple procedural code but code that is well thought out well organized so that as it grows it's

01:46.090 --> 01:55.260
easier and easier to maintain to extend and to reason about hopefully now you feel like you've gained

01:55.260 --> 02:03.140
some superpowers and you're finally able to use OPI to become a better programmer.

02:03.220 --> 02:05.060
I'll see you in the next one by.
