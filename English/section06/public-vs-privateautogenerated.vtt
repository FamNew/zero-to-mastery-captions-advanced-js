In many object oriented programming languages that have classes the idea of private and public fields

00:10.590 --> 00:12.360
are really important.

00:12.630 --> 00:15.940
Now in JavaScript we don't really have that.

00:16.170 --> 00:24.300
And before what a lot of people did was anything that was private that shouldn't be accessed from let's

00:24.300 --> 00:32.640
say a class or even an object we would add an underscore to let other programmers know that hey this

00:32.640 --> 00:35.430
is a private method.

00:35.430 --> 00:40.800
You shouldn't call it because well it's super important that you don't mess with it or you change it

00:41.340 --> 00:45.040
but unfortunately underscore doesn't really do anything.

00:45.090 --> 00:55.230
If I do attack here and let me remove this and I run it and we can't call attack anymore because we

00:55.230 --> 00:57.730
renamed it let me just remove that.

00:58.000 --> 00:58.410
All right.

00:58.410 --> 00:59.170
Attack.

00:59.250 --> 01:09.540
I can still use and I can maybe by mistake reassign it to just false so that now if I call Shrek dot

01:10.110 --> 01:14.210
attack and I spell Shrek correctly.

01:15.470 --> 01:16.120
I get false.

01:16.190 --> 01:22.510
I just went ahead and I've overridden everything that's not good is it.

01:22.520 --> 01:32.300
Well other languages like Java actually have keywords like private that make things private for us and

01:32.390 --> 01:37.670
they are methods that would only be able to be used inside of the class.

01:37.670 --> 01:44.360
Now you can actually solve this issue with something called weak maps in javascript but it's a little

01:44.360 --> 01:53.090
hacky and well we don't want to get into it because there's a proposal coming up and based on when you

01:53.090 --> 01:59.120
watch the video this might already be implemented in JavaScript or it might be a little bit different

02:00.330 --> 02:03.240
the Atma script proposal is in stationary.

02:03.240 --> 02:10.440
So that is it's getting pretty close to being part of the language and it's for class field declarations

02:10.680 --> 02:14.510
and there's a few changes that can happen in here.

02:14.520 --> 02:23.580
For example instead of having to call constructor on state that perhaps doesn't require parameters we

02:23.580 --> 02:34.650
can do something like Age equals fifty four and this will be part of the state that we can use in other

02:34.650 --> 02:35.100
areas.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.700
So in my attack I could say this dot H.

02:39.060 --> 02:46.730
So we don't have to go through the constructor when we don't have parameters but the other thing is

02:46.970 --> 02:49.250
we can make things private.

02:49.520 --> 03:00.480
If we add the pound sign like this it says this is a private variable and if I try and access H outside

03:00.480 --> 03:07.890
of this class maybe as part of the instances here with Shrek or Dobie Well it's not going to let me

03:09.460 --> 03:18.550
now for now we're most likely the closest to doing something like this where we can have private state

03:18.790 --> 03:27.490
that is private data that can only be accessed inside of the class like this but private methods is

03:27.490 --> 03:33.670
something that we are still working towards again depending on when you watch the video.

03:33.670 --> 03:39.270
This feature might be implemented maybe we won't use the pound sign anymore and it'll be something different.

03:39.430 --> 03:44.080
But for now you can see the progress is well not the fastest.

03:44.470 --> 03:52.750
If we scroll all the way down we see that the proposal of private state started July 2016 and it's still

03:52.750 --> 03:59.710
going through everything we have a stage 3 but there's now class fields and private methods that have

03:59.710 --> 04:01.770
been updated to State Street.

04:01.780 --> 04:09.760
So keep an eye out on this feature but be mindful that in JavaScript the idea of private and public

04:09.940 --> 04:19.020
is still in the works the properties and methods are available and cannot be private at least for now.

04:19.210 --> 04:20.910
I'll see in the next video by.
