00:00.800 --> 00:04.440
Let's get into object oriented programming.

00:04.490 --> 00:09.920
We're gonna be talking about some things that we've actually already covered but we're gonna dive deep

00:09.920 --> 00:10.870
this time.

00:10.970 --> 00:14.960
Things like the this keyword prototype of inheritance.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.450
The new keyword the new iOS 6 classes.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.980
The idea of inheritance object to create.

00:22.130 --> 00:24.530
These are all important things.

00:24.590 --> 00:33.080
We're also going to talk about private and public fields the idea of class based inheritance that we

00:33.080 --> 00:34.800
might see in things like Java.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.630
And then finally cover the four principles of object oriented programming.

00:39.980 --> 00:46.340
Now object oriented programming has been around since the 70s and it's a style of programming that is

00:46.340 --> 00:55.630
very common in languages like C sharp Python Ruby and obviously Java in O P.

00:55.630 --> 01:04.770
An object is a box containing information and operations that are supposed to refer to the same concept.

01:04.780 --> 01:11.220
It's like we're modeling real world objects and we've seen this before right.

01:11.230 --> 01:22.090
Remember when we had the dragon object we actually had some o p principles in here we had data about

01:22.090 --> 01:30.160
the dragon such as name and ability to breathe fire and we also had methods actions that the dragon

01:30.220 --> 01:32.950
can take in 0 0 P.

01:32.950 --> 01:43.960
This data can also be called state and we've wrapped this dragon in an object to model real world dragon

01:44.350 --> 01:50.720
that contains some sort of data about the dragon and also the actions that the dragon can take these

01:51.020 --> 01:58.670
attributes or properties allows to keep track of the state of the object and these methods allow us

01:58.670 --> 02:07.460
to manipulate the state of the object so that we model the real world and that's what we want to do

02:07.460 --> 02:09.090
with object oriented programming.

02:09.110 --> 02:15.470
We want to look at the world and organize our code and the things that we want to do into these small

02:15.770 --> 02:24.290
little object boxes that interact with each other so that we keep everything divided and organized and

02:24.530 --> 02:31.760
when it comes to object oriented programming there's two main types there's class based programming

02:31.760 --> 02:35.780
languages and prototype based programming languages.

02:35.780 --> 02:45.080
And as we know with JavaScript we have prototype all inheritance by the end of the o p part.

02:45.080 --> 02:51.620
I want you to be comfortable with the idea of why it allows us to have code that we can reason about

02:53.740 --> 03:00.810
and to get started with the section and start learning some object oriented programming principles.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.080
Have a nice little cartoon here.

03:03.680 --> 03:11.390
Maybe you won't get it now but by the end of this section hopefully this cartoon is hilarious to you.

03:11.390 --> 03:18.860
Object oriented programming is all about modeling real world objects and relationships.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.660
I'll see in the next one.

03:20.020 --> 03:20.420
Bye bye.
