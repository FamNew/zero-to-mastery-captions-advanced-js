Welcome back.

00:02.340 --> 00:09.200
Whether you know it or not you can now spot object oriented programming in the wild.

00:09.200 --> 00:16.340
For example if you've ever used we act as a front end library you can see some sample code here and

00:16.790 --> 00:17.810
how they've used.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.370
Object Oriented Programming principles.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.970
We can now look at the code and understand a lot better.

00:24.050 --> 00:35.250
Right for example we have a toggle class that we create that extends react dot component react dot component

00:35.640 --> 00:39.380
is something that comes from the REACT team.

00:39.510 --> 00:48.840
They've built this class that has all these features for us so that while we can use things like render

00:49.170 --> 00:53.780
that comes automatically for us so that we can run code like this.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.740
And our application gets rendered.

00:55.740 --> 01:04.950
So we're using somebody else's code and we're extending react component and using the base functionality

01:04.950 --> 01:08.590
there to add our own little features.

01:08.790 --> 01:12.810
We have constructors that will receive props.

01:12.810 --> 01:20.730
We have state which is the state of our toggle class as you can see we have an object with is toggle

01:21.090 --> 01:22.270
honest true.

01:22.380 --> 01:30.640
And then we create our own methods on this class such as handling the click and then at the end we return

01:30.790 --> 01:39.860
a button that well is a toggle button and we also see here how we have the bind over here.

01:40.290 --> 01:47.130
And we've talked about this right because this is what we call a callback function.

01:47.420 --> 01:54.720
That is when we run handle click we want this dot set St..

01:54.790 --> 02:05.340
The this keyword to refer to the toggle class and not the actual button that we click in here.

02:05.440 --> 02:11.840
We have to bind it that is I'm telling hey this dot handle click.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.310
I want you to bind to the toggle class so that when I do this dot handle click a method on this property

02:21.900 --> 02:28.310
that this keyword is referring to the class and not the actual button clicked on it and although this

02:28.310 --> 02:35.930
is just an example you can now understand and notice when Object Oriented Programming principles are

02:35.930 --> 02:43.010
used in libraries frameworks and any other code written by somebody else.

02:43.010 --> 02:47.600
And trust me object oriented programming is everywhere.

02:47.600 --> 02:53.060
And now that you have the skills you're going to understand it and you're gonna notice it more and more

02:53.360 --> 03:00.760
out in the wild so start exploring the library and framework world and see if you can notice any patterns

03:00.790 --> 03:02.470
that we've learned so far.

03:02.740 --> 03:04.070
I'll see in the next one.

03:04.140 --> 03:04.580
Bye.
