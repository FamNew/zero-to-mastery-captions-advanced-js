00:01.330 --> 00:02.470
Welcome back.

00:02.500 --> 00:06.330
Now there is a big debate in the javascript community.

00:06.550 --> 00:13.060
People that love classes and people that never want to use them never want to see this new keyword and

00:13.360 --> 00:20.120
they just want to avoid using this keyword too much because they say it causes too much confusion and

00:20.570 --> 00:23.170
this is just personal preference.

00:23.270 --> 00:29.960
Highly respected programmers love classes other highly respected programmers hate classes and there's

00:29.960 --> 00:37.550
no right or wrong here but I do want to add a note that what you see here can be accomplished with object

00:37.610 --> 00:43.730
Doc create as we've seen in the previous videos and with object does create.

00:43.820 --> 00:47.470
We actually have everything we need with what some would say.

00:47.480 --> 00:56.100
None of the mess we're able to create these prototype chains without pretending like we have classes.

00:56.180 --> 01:03.020
Some people call using object Doc create pure prototype all inheritance as in that's the pure way of

01:03.020 --> 01:06.830
doing it instead of pretending like we're something else.

01:06.830 --> 01:09.240
What you use is up to you.

01:09.320 --> 01:16.910
However most of the javascript community doesn't use object to create as much as the class syntax.

01:16.910 --> 01:24.770
So in most code bases especially the New York code bases that use object oriented programming principles

01:25.220 --> 01:27.830
we'll use class.

01:27.830 --> 01:32.130
But the beauty with javascript like I said is that it's multi paradigm.

01:32.180 --> 01:38.720
It allows us to have a lot of options to code the way that we want it based on the problem at hand and

01:38.720 --> 01:43.010
based on what type of team dynamic you have with other programmers.

01:43.010 --> 01:45.860
So at the end of the day it's up to you.

01:46.010 --> 01:47.750
I'll see in the next one by.
