Welcome back.

00:01.870 --> 00:12.960
It's time to do another fun array interview question an interviewer asks you given to a race that are

00:12.960 --> 00:14.380
sorted.

00:14.540 --> 00:21.150
Can you merge these two arrays into one big one that's still sorted.

00:21.620 --> 00:30.720
So if I have a function called merge sorted arrays and I give it two parameters with two sorted arrays.

00:31.010 --> 00:39.890
Can you make it so that it returns 0 3 4 4 6 30 31 as you can see completely sorted.

00:39.970 --> 00:43.820
Let's see we can come up with and I'll see you in the solution video by.
