00:00.790 --> 00:01.750
Welcome back.

00:01.750 --> 00:04.440
Let's get into some fun interview questions.

00:04.690 --> 00:10.570
We're going to start off with a very very common one and it shouldn't be too complicated to start us

00:10.570 --> 00:18.930
off the interviewer asks you can you create a function that reverses a string.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.850
So if you passed into this function right here.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.860
Hi my name is Andre.

00:25.860 --> 00:30.250
It should return this gibberish that is.

00:30.250 --> 00:35.580
Oh and I forgot m here.

00:35.670 --> 00:39.700
His gibberish that is well backwards.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.970
It's just simply reversing a string.

00:42.970 --> 00:50.620
Now I wanted to go ahead and try this in your own reptile that i t or whichever text editor you use

00:51.130 --> 00:59.730
and see if he can think through the problem use what you know about arrays to solve this.

00:59.730 --> 01:06.570
Now keep in mind when it comes to questions like these there are many ways to do things as programmers

01:06.600 --> 01:07.710
we know this right.

01:07.740 --> 01:15.010
There are so many ways to solve a problem and depending on our style our knowledge and time we're going

01:15.000 --> 01:17.040
to come up with different solutions.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.140
So if your answer is different than mine.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.770
Well that's not the worst thing.

01:22.770 --> 01:28.170
What you want to be able to do is to think through a problem and understand why you made those decisions.

01:28.170 --> 01:33.020
So go ahead reverse the string and I'll see you in the solution video.
