00:01.230 --> 00:03.420
What is a data structure.

00:04.630 --> 00:13.940
A data structure is a collection of values algorithms are the steps or processes we put into place to

00:13.940 --> 00:17.630
manipulate these collection of values.

00:17.640 --> 00:26.110
It's what allows us to write programs a person who knows how data structures and algorithms work and

00:26.110 --> 00:31.400
how to use them can write programs great programs.

00:31.410 --> 00:38.880
The beauty is that these are timeless no matter what programming language you use whether you prefer

00:39.060 --> 00:46.920
one library over the other whether you write code in angular or react in the front end development world

00:47.430 --> 00:49.740
or you're a game developer.

00:49.740 --> 00:54.360
Underneath it all it's all data structures and algorithms.

00:54.360 --> 01:01.110
If you understand these then you can really easily adapt and tackle all sorts of technical problems.

01:02.160 --> 01:10.770
It is why companies like Facebook Amazon Netflix Google ask questions specific to Data Structures and

01:10.770 --> 01:18.060
Algorithms because although it may be important to know the latest and greatest javascript syntax or

01:18.150 --> 01:26.610
maybe the latest and greatest library those things change if you know the fundamentals so then they

01:26.610 --> 01:32.000
can throw you any problem any situation and you're able to make the right decision.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.510
This knowledge is extremely valuable.

01:34.620 --> 01:40.800
The longer you are in the field the more and more you realize that you need these fundamental principles

01:40.800 --> 01:46.350
of data structures and algorithms in order to be a great developer or engineer.

01:46.350 --> 01:49.920
So let's get started with that over the next few sections.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.960
We have a long way to go to get familiar with data structures and algorithms so you can write great

01:54.960 --> 01:56.160
programs.

01:56.190 --> 01:56.880
Let's get started.
