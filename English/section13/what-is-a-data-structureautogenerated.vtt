00:00.950 --> 00:01.430
Welcome back.

00:02.970 --> 00:11.880
What is a data structure a data structure is a collection of values the values can have relationships

00:11.880 --> 00:14.660
among them and they can have functions applied to them.

00:15.710 --> 00:24.590
Each one is different in what it can do and what it is best used for most important thing to take away

00:24.830 --> 00:31.570
is that each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.

00:32.150 --> 00:36.140
All right Andre you just said a bunch of words and I don't really understand.

00:36.800 --> 00:42.030
Well let's show you a couple of images to simplify this you see.

00:42.040 --> 00:50.540
You can think of data structures as any sort of compartment or container a data structure is simply

00:50.540 --> 00:53.280
a file cabinet of different types.

00:53.360 --> 01:00.320
You have a backpack a place where you put maybe your school books you have drawers where you put your

01:00.320 --> 01:07.970
clothes fridge where you put your food a folder for your files and a packing box maybe for your toys

01:09.880 --> 01:14.950
each one of these containers are useful for it's own thing.

01:14.950 --> 01:21.730
For example I'm not going to put my food in a drawer over here because that yogurt is going to go bad

01:21.730 --> 01:32.510
here likewise I'm not going to put all my papers and files in my backpack or perhaps a toy box because

01:32.530 --> 01:34.210
it's just going to get crumpled up.

01:34.390 --> 01:40.910
Each one of these containers are specific for it's own thing and that's what data structure really is.

01:40.960 --> 01:48.370
It's a way for us to organize data so that we can go into the backpack and retrieve that data really

01:48.370 --> 01:48.910
easily.

01:48.910 --> 01:55.060
We can go into the fridge and grab that popsicle or ice cream really fast.

01:55.060 --> 02:00.670
We can put things in data structures and we can take things from data structures and that's all it really

02:00.670 --> 02:08.300
is and there are a ton of data structures just like in our real life how we have all these containers

02:08.630 --> 02:16.930
hold these places to put things in in programming we have a ton of them if we go to Wikipedia for example

02:16.960 --> 02:23.200
well if we scroll through here we see a ton of data structures and this is going to look overwhelming

02:23.230 --> 02:30.400
but don't worry most of these well I've never encountered myself and they're very very specific.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.190
You probably only have about five or six data structures that are really really important that we're

02:36.190 --> 02:39.960
going to go over.

02:39.980 --> 02:48.640
You may have even heard of Bitcoin and how it uses block chain technology this magical word well block

02:48.640 --> 02:54.400
chain at the end of the day is simply a data structure a way to hold information

02:57.290 --> 03:06.290
so in our programming world data structures we can store things like numbers strings boolean types just

03:06.290 --> 03:14.030
like we saw when we coded in javascript with arrays and objects arrays and objects in javascript are

03:14.150 --> 03:21.490
each a form of a data structure that allows us to store information you see as humans.

03:21.490 --> 03:23.940
This is what we do on Earth right.

03:23.950 --> 03:29.350
We take the chaos and the disorder and make order out of it.

03:29.350 --> 03:33.850
At least we try to we organize our farms to produce food.

03:33.850 --> 03:40.000
We package the food and we deliver them to the grocery stores and organize them in the grocery store

03:40.000 --> 03:48.280
so that humans can grab those and can then purchase these groceries and give money to put in a compartment

03:48.370 --> 03:49.980
and a bank.

03:50.050 --> 03:50.950
That's what programs are.

03:50.950 --> 03:58.710
We're modeling real life scenarios and the more advanced a developer you become the more time you'll

03:58.760 --> 04:04.090
start thinking and spending time talking about data structures.

04:04.100 --> 04:11.780
This is why interviewers love to talk about data structures now as I always like to mention there are

04:11.870 --> 04:13.820
always tradeoffs.

04:13.910 --> 04:16.790
Every programming question has a tradeoff.

04:16.790 --> 04:24.410
Remember our three pillars of readability memory and speed.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.790
When we talked about what code is best.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.670
Well we have the same thing with data structures.

04:29.770 --> 04:34.200
One is better than the other in some aspects and the other better than the other.

04:34.210 --> 04:35.320
That's why they exist.

04:35.320 --> 04:43.700
Each one for its own specific case and there are two parts to understanding data structures.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.150
One is how to actually build one.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.710
How can we build with code.

04:48.710 --> 04:54.010
Some of these data structures and two is how to use them.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.300
How to use these data structures.

04:56.300 --> 05:02.990
We're gonna do both of these in this course but the second point is the most important right because

05:03.830 --> 05:11.670
data structures are usually just tools and most of the time they're already pre-built.

05:11.710 --> 05:17.070
For us the most important part is how to use them when to use one over the other.

05:17.140 --> 05:22.540
And we kind of saw a little bit of that in the previous section when we talked about how to solve problems

05:22.810 --> 05:30.790
where we used an object versus an array to make our code more efficient.

05:30.810 --> 05:35.880
The goal in this course is to understand data structure so that you can pick the right data structure

05:35.880 --> 05:37.020
for your problem.

05:37.750 --> 05:42.660
Based on different scenarios data needs to be stored in a specific format.

05:42.790 --> 05:50.430
We have a handful of data structures that cover our need to store data in different formats so let's

05:50.430 --> 05:52.320
get a little bit deeper into this topic.
