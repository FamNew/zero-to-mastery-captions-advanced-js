Welcome back.

00:02.590 --> 00:09.490
Why hash tables hash tables are great when you want quick access to certain values.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.930
We remember that searching through an array for an item takes a really long time.

00:14.930 --> 00:21.620
We have to loop through every item and see if a certain string or a set number is in an array with hash

00:21.620 --> 00:22.190
tables.

00:22.280 --> 00:29.430
That's really really fast and this is why you see hash tables in places like databases right.

00:29.450 --> 00:36.490
We want to search for something in a database and a gives it back to us right away similarly inserting

00:36.520 --> 00:46.450
items in and a hash table on like an array that might shift indexes is typically of one.

00:46.450 --> 00:53.090
You just simply have to hash and create the key although we have those cases of collision.

00:53.200 --> 00:58.150
Most of the time that's something that we don't need to worry about too much and we can assume an insert

00:58.180 --> 01:04.950
of all one then there's other aspects that are quite similar between the two arrays let you quickly

01:04.950 --> 01:06.960
look up the value for a given.

01:06.960 --> 01:15.610
Key keys are called indexes in an array and we don't get to pick them it's always 0 1 2 3 in hash tables.

01:15.690 --> 01:23.450
We can pick them so hash tables is kind of like a hack on top of an array to let us use flexible keys

01:24.410 --> 01:34.290
instead of being stuck with 0 1 2 3 a problem of hash tables that we discussed was the idea of no concept

01:34.290 --> 01:42.520
of order in arrays each item was placed next to each other on a shelf in memory hash tables are kind

01:42.520 --> 01:43.590
of placed all over the place.

01:45.560 --> 01:51.590
Now that we have an idea of the differences between the two I think it's time for us to actually work

01:51.590 --> 01:58.430
on some exercises and interview questions that we'll use hash tables in their answers.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.170
I'll see you on that one.
