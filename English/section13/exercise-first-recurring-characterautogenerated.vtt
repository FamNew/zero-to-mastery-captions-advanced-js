Welcome back.

00:02.560 --> 00:10.430
It's time for an exciting interview question and this question comes straight from Google given NRA.

00:10.450 --> 00:13.040
Let's say that looks like this.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.450
Tell me the first recurring character.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.500
What does that mean.

00:17.500 --> 00:23.730
Well if we look at this array over here I want a function that I can enter this array.

00:23.920 --> 00:31.450
This input is going to look through all the numbers and tell me which one gets repeated first.

00:31.480 --> 00:40.870
So we look at 2 5 1 and 2 and we say 2 has already been seen.

00:41.050 --> 00:49.350
2 is the recurring number if we look at another example we see 2 1 1 and 0.

00:49.380 --> 00:55.800
We stop here because 1 We've already seen before we can say the first recurring character is 1.

00:55.800 --> 01:03.540
If we get an array that has all unique items we just return undefined.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.000
So how would you go about solving this.

01:07.010 --> 01:14.460
Give it a go see what you come up with if you need help perhaps go on discord and chat with some of

01:14.460 --> 01:17.640
the community members and I'll see you in the solution video.
