00:00.960 --> 00:02.370
Welcome back.

00:02.370 --> 00:08.190
There are quite a few data structures that you may be asked in an entry and we saw how many of them

00:08.220 --> 00:10.110
there are on that wikipedia page.

00:10.290 --> 00:14.750
But luckily for you the list isn't actually that intimidating.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.350
All you need to learn are these ones over here.

00:18.390 --> 00:19.490
These are used.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.350
I would say 90 percent of the time and this is what we're going to talk about in our course.

00:25.350 --> 00:30.770
Now there may be specific ones within these groups and each one of them has tradeoffs.

00:30.960 --> 00:36.780
But as long as you learn these and you learn when and why you should use them then you're going to be

00:36.780 --> 00:38.700
miles ahead of most people.

00:38.790 --> 00:44.410
It's gonna be a lot of fun now before we get going.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.790
I want to note one last thing.

00:46.990 --> 00:56.530
You see each language has their own data types or built in data types javascript for example has numbers

00:57.220 --> 01:09.540
strings has billions which are true false and then some strange ones like undefined and each language

01:09.540 --> 01:15.120
has data structures to organize these data types.

01:15.120 --> 01:23.930
So for example in JavaScript we have arrays and objects that we use and they are data types.

01:23.970 --> 01:32.220
It allows us to structure and organize information such as our primitive data types or even hold more

01:32.220 --> 01:37.590
complex ones like having an array that contains multiple objects.

01:37.590 --> 01:43.500
And we're going to talk about this in more detail but I want to show you that we do have different languages

01:43.560 --> 01:47.760
that have different access to some data structures.

01:47.790 --> 01:55.080
You can see over here some of the other languages that we can use in this course and whether they have

01:55.080 --> 01:56.220
them available.

01:56.310 --> 02:01.940
We see that Java has arrays has linked lists stacks.

02:02.310 --> 02:07.020
We have priority to cues and many other types.

02:07.080 --> 02:15.240
Now does that mean that if we're using JavaScript we can only use arrays and objects.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.940
Well no not really.

02:18.330 --> 02:21.980
Although these languages come with data structures built in.

02:22.050 --> 02:30.660
We can also built our own in most languages have enough data structures and data types for us to build

02:31.740 --> 02:42.720
and create our own data structures so if javascript doesn't have stacks Well we can build one now to

02:42.720 --> 02:47.260
finish this section and finally dive into our first data structure.

02:47.300 --> 02:53.480
I wanted to just remind you that we have a little map over here of what we need to know for the coding

02:53.480 --> 02:54.440
interview.

02:54.440 --> 03:02.090
Now in this map I have a little present emoji next to each one of the data structures that we're going

03:02.090 --> 03:09.060
to talk about as you can see there aren't that many of them and many of them are quite related or are

03:09.060 --> 03:17.030
children of the other but use this as a reference for you to just draw a map of how things are connected

03:17.270 --> 03:23.310
and what the data structures are that we're going to talk about but let's get our hands dirty with our

03:23.310 --> 03:24.880
first data structure.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.790
I'll see in the next one by.
