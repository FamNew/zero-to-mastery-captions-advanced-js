Welcome back.

00:02.020 --> 00:08.310
I wanted to add a quick video to let you know about a common interview trick we're going to be doing

00:08.310 --> 00:16.860
some array questions after this but in interviews you should treat any string questions like over here

00:17.430 --> 00:18.510
as an array.

00:18.510 --> 00:26.440
QUESTION You see strings are simply array of characters most of the time in an interview.

00:26.500 --> 00:34.430
When you get a question like reverse a string what you should be thinking is to convert this into an

00:34.430 --> 00:42.230
array do some sort of a loop on it or an operation using something like a split method in JavaScript

00:42.710 --> 00:50.700
and then returning it as a string after you've finished the operations with them so that is a very common

00:50.760 --> 00:54.050
interview question where you're manipulating strings.

00:54.060 --> 00:59.820
Just keep that in mind and we'll actually demonstrate this in the next video when we do a very common

00:59.820 --> 01:03.700
interview question I'll see you on that one by.
