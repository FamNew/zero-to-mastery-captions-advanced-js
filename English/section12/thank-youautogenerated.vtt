00:00.990 --> 00:04.950
I wanted to take this last opportunity to say thank you.

00:04.950 --> 00:07.590
Thank you for following along in the course.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.510
I hope I didn't bug you too much.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.750
I hope you had fun.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.660
I hope you learned a lot.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.500
And again thank you for supporting my work.

00:15.510 --> 00:21.870
I wouldn't be able to do what I do now without people like you that follow along and take that leap

00:21.870 --> 00:24.120
of faith to take a course like this.

00:24.210 --> 00:30.030
So I hope you'll join me in future courses and stick around our community because I think we have something

00:30.030 --> 00:35.120
great here and I hope that I'm able to help you along in your career for many more years to come.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.750
Until next time.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.100
Bye bye.
